              This is a common myth circulated on social media, but Controlled Parking Zones are primarily introduced to manage limited street space, reduce congestion, and improve parking availability for residents and businesses.

              Any revenue generated from permit fees and enforcement is reinvested into transport infrastructure, road maintenance, and sustainable travel initiatives. This is mandated by law under <a href=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/27/section/55>section 55 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act (1984)</a>.

              Edinburgh, like many cities, has experienced steady population growth and increasing car ownership — particularly in built-up residential areas like Portobello. The population of Edinburgh increased by 12.3% between 2010 and 2020. This has put significant pressure on on-street parking and local infrastructure.
              <br/><br/>
              What may have worked in the past no longer meets today’s demands. Rising congestion, commuter parking, and limited space for residents have all contributed to the need for better parking management. 
              <br/><br/>
              Air and noise pollution have proven negative effects on health and wellbeing, including links to dementia, type 2 diabetes and poor mental health. 2,700 deaths per year in Scotland are attributed to long-term exposure to air pollution, and respiratory disease affects 1 in 5 people in the UK.
              <br/><br/>
              A CPZ is a way to fairly allocate limited parking, reduce unnecessary traffic, and improve the overall quality of life in affected neighbourhoods.

              Concerns about the CPZs potentially deterring customers are valid; however, businesses in other CPZ areas such as Edinburgh City Centre, Leith and Morningside have continued success. Increased footfall from customers using sustainable transport has contributed towards this.
              <br/><br/>
              Businesses within the CPZ can <a href=https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/parking-permits/retail-trades-business-permits/1>apply for a business permit. The consultation is open until 23rd May 2025, for businesses to engage with any concerns.</a>.

            <div class="accordion-body">
              Blue Badge holders are generally not negatively affected by the introduction of a CPZ. In Edinburgh, Blue Badge holders can park:
              <br/><br/>
              <ul>
                <li>Free of charge in pay-and-display and shared-use parking bays</li>
                <li>Without a time limit, unless signs indicate otherwise</li>
                <li>On single or double yellow lines for up to 3 hours, provided it is safe and does not cause an obstruction</li>
              </ul>
              These concessions remain in place across all Controlled Parking Zones. The CPZ does not override Blue Badge rights, and the city continues to support accessible parking options.

        <!-- Question 9 -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <h2 class="accordion-header" id="faq9-heading">
            <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#faq9" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq9">
              <i class="bi bi-clock-history me-3"></i>Can I park my car using pay and display for the whole day?
            </button>
          </h2>
          <div id="faq9" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="faq9-heading" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
            <div class="accordion-body">
              No, pay-and-display parking has a maximum stay of 4 hours. This means you cannot park all day using a standard pay-and-display ticket.
              <br/><br/>
              This time limit is designed to ensure a healthy turnover of parking spaces, so that more people — including residents, visitors, and local business customers — have a fair chance to find a space. It helps reduce long-term commuter parking that can monopolise limited on-street availability.
              <br/><br/>
              If you need to park for longer, you may need to use off-street car parks, active travel options, or public transport. This approach supports more equitable and sustainable use of shared urban space.

            <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#faq10" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq10">
              <i class="bi bi-house-door me-3"></i>My street is included within the CPZ, but I don't often have parking problems. Why is this necessary?
            </button>
          </h2>
          <div id="faq10" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="faq10-heading" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
            <div class="accordion-body">
              Even if you don't currently experience parking problems on your street, the introduction of a CPZ is a preventative measure designed to address the "overspill" of long term parking from the centre of the CPZ. In addition, future issues may arise as the area grows and changes. Edinburgh has seen increasing demand for parking spaces due to factors such as population growth, tourism, and local events.
              <br/><br/>
              The CPZ helps ensure that parking spaces are fairly distributed, reduce long-term parking by commuters, and maintain access to spaces for local residents, visitors, and businesses. It also improves traffic flow and air quality, as vehicles are less likely to circle the area looking for parking.
              <br/><br/>
              It's important to note that CPZ boundaries are often planned based on traffic patterns and broader planning considerations. Even if parking isn't a problem now, it is likely to become an issue in the future.

        <!-- Question 11 -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <h2 class="accordion-header" id="faq11-heading">
            <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#faq11" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq11">
              <i class="bi bi-lock me-3"></i>The  CPZ is designed to keep us in 15-minute zones, to take away our freedom. Is this true?
            </button>
          </h2>
          <div id="faq11" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="faq11-heading" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
            <div class="accordion-body">
              The purpose of CPZs is not to restrict people's freedom but to manage limited parking space fairly and efficiently. The idea of a "15-minute zone" is misunderstood, and often posted on social media as a conspiracy theory.
              <br/><br/>
              Rather than limiting freedom, the goal is to ensure parking is more accessible to those who truly need it for short-term purposes, while encouraging other forms of sustainable transport for longer trips (like walking, cycling, or public transport).
              <br/><br/>
              Additionally, CPZs help reduce congestion and improve air quality by minimising cars circling in search of parking and discouraging commuters from using residential streets for all-day parking. The implementation of these zones is part of a broader plan to make cities more livable and sustainable, and not to restrict residents' rights.
