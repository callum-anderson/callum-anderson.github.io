      <p>Hi, I'm Callum Anderson, and I'm a member of Cohort E24 at <a href="https://www.codeclan.com">Codeclan</a>.
      I've created this webpage mainly to share my experiences of learning at CodeClan, as I know I was
     very interested to hear current/previous students' thoughts before I signed up.</p>
      <quote>So...  who are you??</quote>
      <p>OK, bit of background! I've worked in the NHS for the past decade, in various admin and
        IT roles. Prior to that, I worked in retail for a number of years, after dropping
        out of Uni. Definitely a big regret, but, I had my reasons at the time.</p>
      <img class="right images" src="./img/callum_photo.jpg" width="197px" height="220px" alt="Photo of Callum Anderson, full height, outside"/>
      <p>More recently, I've been involved in project work, which has piqued
        my interest in software development. I've seen at close quarters how good quality software
        can be hugely beneficial to the daily activities of staff - saving time, effort and decreasing
      stress levels. However, I've often thought you know, that's good...  but it could be <em>better</em>.
    Whenever I've seen repetitive manual tasks carried out on a daily basis, I've thought <em>wouldn't it be
   so much easier if we had an app which does all that for us?</em></p>
   <quote>He who dares, Rodders, he who dares!</quote>
        <p>I have dabbled with coding in my spare time, using sites such as
      <a href="https://www.codeacademy.com" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a> and <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>,
    but I decided that I wanted to take it to the next level and actually become a developer. <em>Somehow.</em></p>
      <p>That's when I heard about CodeClan, and how they can fast track you towards becoming a trainee/junior
      developer in 16 weeks. A long, intense 16 weeks...  putting in a minimum of 60 hours a week. The guys at
    CodeClan strongly emphasise this, as do the students who have been through it. A part time job while studying
  isn't recommended, so you're essentially unemployed for 16 weeks. Then there are the course fees, which can be
postponed until after the course with a <a href="https://codeclan.com/courses/16-week-course/course-cost/" target="_blank">PCDL
  loan</a>, which is what I've done.</p>
    <p>Here's the big draw though - CodeClan don't just teach you how to code. They get you "industry ready", and
      prep you to find a job at the end of it. They teach you how to learn, which sounds kind of crazy, but I'll
      go into more detail in my blog. In fact, on that note, I'll stop there - but please do go on to read more
      in my blog if you're interested. There are contact details at the bottom of the page as well, if you want
      to ask me anything...  happy to help if I can!
