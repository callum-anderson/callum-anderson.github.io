            <p>Hi, I'm Callum Anderson, and I'm a member of Cohort E24 at <a href="https://www.codeclan.com">Codeclan</a>.
            I've created this webpage mainly to share my experiences of learning at CodeClan, as I know I was
           very interested to hear current/previous students' thoughts before I signed up.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're thinking about signing up for CodeClan, or you have any questions, please do get in touch
                and I'll do my best to help!
            </p>

            <q>So...  who are you??</q>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-9">
            <p>OK, bit of background! I've worked in the NHS for the past decade, in various admin and
              IT roles. Prior to that, I worked in retail for a number of years, after dropping
              out of Uni. Definitely a big regret, but, I had my reasons at the time.
            </p>
            <p>More recently, I've been involved in project work, which has piqued
              my interest in software development. I've seen at close quarters how good quality software
              can be hugely beneficial to the daily activities of staff - saving time, effort and decreasing
            stress levels. However, I've often thought you know, that's good...  but it could be <em>better</em>.
          Whenever I've seen repetitive manual tasks carried out on a daily basis, I've thought <em>wouldn't it be
         so much easier if we had an app which does all that for us?</em>
            </p>
            <p>So yes, loads of ideas and inspirations; but equal amounts of frustration because I haven't been able
           to act on them.
            </p>

            <p>I have dabbled with coding in my spare time, using sites such as
          <a href="https://www.codeacademy.com" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a> and <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>,
        but I decided that I wanted to take it to the next level and actually become a developer. <em>Somehow.</em>
            </p>
            <p>That's when I heard about CodeClan, and how they can fast track you towards becoming a trainee/junior
          developer in 16 weeks. A long, intense 16 weeks...  putting in a minimum of 60 hours a week. The guys at
        CodeClan strongly emphasise this, as do the students who have been through it. A part time job while studying
      isn't recommended, so you're essentially unemployed for 16 weeks. Then there are the course fees, which can be
    postponed until after the course with a <a href="https://codeclan.com/courses/16-week-course/course-cost/" target="_blank">PCDL
      loan</a>, which is what I've done.
            </p>
            <p>Here's the big draw though - CodeClan don't just teach you how to code. They get you "industry ready", and
          prep you to find a job at the end of it. They teach you how to learn, which sounds kind of crazy, but I'll
          go into more detail in my blog. In fact, on that note, I'll stop there - but please do go on to read more
          in my blog if you're interested. There are contact details at the bottom of the page as well, if you want
          to ask me anything...  happy to help if I can!
