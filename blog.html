            <p>Well here we are, one week down already! Technically, it's more than one week because we were given
              plenty of pre-course work to do; to make sure we were all ready for the starting line. That
              consisted of:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>How to use a Mac (loads of us are Apple newbies, including myself). This includes learning keyboard shortcuts, which are vital.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/" target="_blank">UNIX commands</a> (ie. how to type stuff into a terminal to work with files/folders, instead of using the mouse). It's faster.</li>
              <li>Using <a href="http://jahya.net/blog/git-vs-github/" target="_blank">Git/Github</a> - which is a version control system to track changes to files you, or your colleagues, are working on.</li>
              <li>Getting your typing speeds up - <a href="http://10fastfingers.com/typing-test" target="_blank">normal</a> and <a href="http://www.speedcoder.net/lessons/" target="_blank">coding</a> speeds. You need to use all those other symbols on the keyboard when coding, the ones you'd normally never touch.</li>
              <li>Completing courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a> - mainly the HTML, CSS and Ruby tracks.
            </ul>

            <p>So, 18 fresh, eager-eyed students walked into CodeClan on <strong>Monday</strong> 30/07/18...  and actually, it was an easy
              first day. We covered Git again, because that would be central throughout the entire course. We upload our
              homework to Github each night for review, and we'll also be using it to collaborate with each other. As it
              happens, this very webpage is hosted on Github! Pretty cool, huh? The entire Github community is built
              around supporting each other. If you upload some code publicly, people can input to it and help you out.
              Completely free of charge. That same community spirit is inherent at CodeClan too. I love that.</p>
              <p>As the week progressed, things picked up pace a bit, as you'd expect. We covered Ruby arrays and hashes, which
                are basically just "collections" of things, or a way to store a bunch of strings (words) or numbers in a single
                container object.</p>

                <q>If you don't ask, the answer is no.</q>
                <p>The actual lessons are quite engaging and interactive - questions are encouraged; and I certainly take
                  good advantage of this. We also get a quick 5-10 minute break every hour which does help to "cool the brain".
                  It's really unlike any other classroom environment I've ever
                  been in - including college and university. The instructors are super chilled, and approachable. It almost feels
                  like they're volunteering to do this, rather than it being their paying job. There are 3 instructors in the room
                  as well, with 1 leading at any time while the other 2 chip in occasionally from the back of the room.

              <div class="col-sm-7">
                <p>We also have "Labs" in the afternoon, where we're typically paired up at random with a fellow student, and
                  have to go off to solve some tasks. When I say "go off", we can either stay in the classroom or head out to the
                  communal areas and sit on the comfy couches. This is known in the industry
                  as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming/" target="_blank">Paired Programming</a>, and I can
                  see the benefits. It only really works if the driver (person typing) is open to input from the navigator.
                  I was paired with three different people over the course of the week and we nailed it each time (top cohort!).
                  It is a bit of a learning curve for us all though.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A former CodeClan student came in to give us a talk on Friday,
                  and she told us that they use Paired Programming where she works now. She said that some of the most skilled and
                  knowledgeable developers aren't necessarily good at working in pairs. Not sure what that tells you, but I found it
                  interesting.</p>

                  <p>We are assigned homework at the end of the day, which consists of a MVP (Minimal Viable Product - a term used
                    in the industry) and Extensions (going that bit further). The Extensions are optional, but I managed to complete them
                    all in the first week. In the mornings, we have a "stand up" first thing, where we all stand in a circle, pass a
                    ball around (only the person with the ball can speak), and share what went well or didn't go well the previous day.
                    This is something that is done in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/agile/what-is-agile" target="_blank">Agile</a>
                    software development companies, and you're encouraged to share any issues you have. I haven't really brought any
                    problems to the table yet, but I've no doubt I will in future. I like it, it's a great way to start the day. This
                    is followed by a homework review, which is really about addressing any problems anyone had, rather than going
                    over all of it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Thursday</strong> is no homework night! As it is our first week, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that CodeClan
                      had put up a tab for us all at a local pub. The other two cohorts were invited too, which was great for networking and to
                      quiz them on what lay ahead. They are 5 and 10 weeks ahead of us respectively. Some of the instructors also made
                      an appearance which was great. I had a great time... <em>but</em>...  made the mistake of heading out on an empty stomach.
                      I suffered for that later. And the next day.

                    <p><strong>Friday</strong> was a bit of a break from coding. We had a lesson about active learning, which was very interesting and
                      definitely useful going forward. Then we had a talk from a previous student (Kate), as mentioned earlier, who has gone
                      on to work in a local tech startup. She was fantastic, very down to earth and has a great sense of humour. She also
                      allayed a lot of fears some of us had. She is the only "junior" developer in her firm, and I asked her if she was
                      intimidated by that. She said she wasn't really, because her manager simply doesn't expect the same level of output from her.
                      I guess that makes sense.</p>
                      <p>We are issued our weekend homework in the afternoon, and some of the guys do it before going home (or as much
                      as they can), and some of us decided to do it all at home. I did the latter this week, but mainly because my stomach was a
                      bit iffy from the previous night's activities! The homework wasn't too bad though. On to <strong>week 2</strong>!

<div id="w2" class="blog-panel">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">

      <p>We started on <strong>Monday</strong> with a "stand up" as always, and generally everyone felt the homework was manageable.
        It wasn't quite how I anticipated it to be, after reading other CodeClanners' blogs. I got the impression that
        homework would be 2-3 hours per night, and maybe 5-10 hours over the weekend. I shouldn't speak too soon -
        that might be still to come! We were then given 1 to 1 sessions with an instructor (out on the comfy seats!)
        to go over the homework and talk through any problems we might have. That took up most of the morning, and to
        be honest, it was nice to have a gentle start to the week. I didn't sleep so well on Sunday night, and I was
        thankful for the free coffee supply at CodeClan.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-7">
      <p>We were introduced to the concept of object-oriented programming and classes, which essentially means that everything
        you use is an object of some sort, and it is created from a blueprint (class). To be honest, I knew most of
        this already, but it was a good review. I'm determined not to fall into the complacency trap. If you think you know
        the subject being taught and switch off, any small details you miss could cost you later. The homework task was about
        creating a library which has books, and the books have rental details etc. Real world examples definitely make it more engaging.
      </p>
      <p>We continued working with classes on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, creating an "ecosystem" of a bear, river and fish. Each was to be
        an object which was created from a class (blueprint), and they all have to interact with each other. In layman's
        terms, the bear takes fish from the river and eats them - essentially meaning the bear has one more fish in its stomach, and
        the river contains one less fish. These things always sound so simple, but it takes a fair bit of code just to get to that point.

      <p>We had another lab in the afternoon with a similar real world scenario - this time it was a bus picking up
        passengers from a bus stop. The number of people at the bus stop changes at every pickup, as does the number of
        people on the bus. That one was kind of fun actually, and we were to continue with it in the homework. A comfortable
        week, up to this point...
      </p>
      <p><strong>Wednesday</strong> was a bit different, as we were given an all-day lab following the homework review. Again, we were
        paired up, and had from 11am until 3:30pm to complete our task. We had to manage our own breaks, and I must say
        I'm not great at taking breaks when I'm focused on something. We did both agree that we should take a proper time-out
        for lunch, to eat and get some fresh air to clear the head. On that point - that is something I've resolved to do
        throughout. I've taken to walking down to Princes Street gardens to get away from the noise and pollution, and to just
        empty the mind of all thoughts. It really works - I come back into class refreshed and ready to go again!
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <q>Do you want to build a Snowman?</q>
      <p><em>Anyway...</em> back to the lab - we were given the choice of two tasks. The first was to create a pub, which obviously
        has drinks, food, and customers. We had to include a check to make sure the customer is over 18 before serving drinks,
        and to refuse to serve them if they're drunk (their "drunkenness" level goes up each time they buy a drink, and down
        if they buy food).<br>
        The other task was to build a Snowman game, which is essentially about guessing a hidden word. We had to output a word to the screen
        in asterisks, and each time the player guessed a letter, it would be uncovered. If they guess wrongly, they'd lose a life. I think
        it's called Snowman because the snowman melts a bit at each wrong guess...  I've always known it as Hangman, but maybe that's no
        longer politically correct?
        So again, the premise sounds very simple, but it was <strong>much</strong> more difficult than the pub task. We wanted a challenge, so
        opted for the Snowman task.<br>
        By 3:30, we had the crux of the game down, but we were still about 15 minutes away from putting it together into a functioning programme. <em>Argh!!</em>
        When we returned to class, we were surprised to find that we had to present our workings to the class. It was so frustrating not having
        the final result there to demo, but that's the way the cookie crumbles.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-7">
      <p>We decided to stay back at the end because we were both so determined to reach the finished product. We managed to get
        that done within half an hour. Again - <em>so</em> infuriating that we didn't have it ready in time for the presentation! Still, it
        was satisfying to finish it off before we left for the day. Our homework task was to review the solution for the <em>other</em> task
        (both solutions were made available to us by the instructors) -
        so for us that would be the pub task. I decided to go one step further and actually complete the task. I started it on the bus home,
        and finished it later on that night. It helped having seen the presentations from the other guys who had chosen that task.
      </p>
      <p>On <strong>Thursday</strong>, we went over enumeration methods, which is a way of iterating through a collection. For example, the .each
        enumeration method takes a collection of objects, and carries out a specified task on that object. One analogy might be
        "for each customer that enters the restaurant, give them a menu". No homework that night, and I decided to get an early
        night to catch up on my sleep. No shenanigans this week!

      <p>We were handed our homework after stand up on <strong>Friday</strong>, and started on that at about 10:30. Most of us headed out to the lounge area,
        it just makes for a nice change of scenery from the classroom. The task this weekend was to create a sort of karaoke club management
        system. So, the club would have a bar, private rooms, guests/punters, songs/playlists and drink/food. So, similar to the pub task on
        Wednesday in many ways, but ramped up a bit. I got the core part of it (Minimum Viable Product) done before heading home. It's strongly recommended that you make a good start on the homework on Friday before leaving, as the
        instructors can't really help you if you're at home. Makes sense!
      </p>
      <p>A developer from a company called <a href="https://www.airts.co.uk" target="_blank">AIRTS</a> came in to give us a talk at lunchtime,
        which is apparently a regular thing on Fridays. His company have employed about 5 CodeClan graduates to date, and he was really
        encouraging, and gave good insights into the industry. Very down to earth too.
      </p>
      <p>Over the weekend, I worked on advanced elements of the Karaoke Club task. I thought about bringing it alive, and making it into a
        text-based menu system, but decided against it! I thought I'd use the remaining time over the weekend to look at other learning support
        sites that have been recommended to us. Namely <a href="https://exercism.io" target="_blank">Exercism</a> and
        <a href="https://www.codewars.com" target="_blank">Code Wars</a>. Both are community based sites that provide coding challenges, which can
        be completed in various ways. It's great to see the alternative solutions, they could come in handy in future! So that's it, on to
        <strong>week 3</strong> of the long and winding code!

  <p>Into week 3 and admittedly the novelty has worn off a little, but I'm still enjoying it a
    great deal. When I got in on <strong>Monday</strong> morning, we had our usual catch up before the
    instructors arrived. Most of us agreed that it was so much easier getting out of bed in the
    mornings; we all chose to be there and have the same desire to learn.
</p>
<p>
We started the week with an introduction to database queries, in the form of PostgreSQL. For
those unfamiliar with the concept of databases, it's essentially like a collection of data
tables that connect with each other.
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp" target="_blank">SQL (Structured Query
  Language)</a> is the set of instructions
you give to the database to get data back. Up to this point, everything we've coded has only lived
in memory. In other words, you can run the program and make changes, but it's all reset/lost once
you close it. Now, we're able to save information into the database to call on again later. This
is known as data "persistence".
OK, the database is stored on our laptops and only we can get to it; but it's still an important
milestone!

<strong>Tuesday</strong> was a continuation of learning about databases. There is a lot to learn
and we've only really scratched the surface at this point. I have some knowledge of SQL queries
which does help a bit, but it's still been a bit of a struggle getting the syntax right. In the
world of literature or printed media, leaving a comma or semi-colon out of a sentence might be
frowned upon by the grammar police. In programming - the entire thing grinds to a halt.<br>
One of
the key skills taught by CodeClan is how to understand error messages, in order to pinpoint the
fault and correct it. It's extremely frustrating at this stage, because we're all repeatedly
making avoidable errors. I guess it's similar to learning a new language or learning to play an
instrument - sometimes you take a step back for every two forward.
</p>
<p>
Getting back to databases, we learned about "one to one" (rarely used), "one to many" and "many
to many" database relationships. In real terms, "one to many" could be like someone's shoe
collection - one person and many pairs of shoes. "Many to many" might be musicians and songs. A
musician has many songs, and a popular song might be played by many musicians.<br>
Up to this point, we'd been using a pizza shop model as a working example. We mimicked a customer
ordering pizzas. So again, a customer could place many orders, which would be a "one to many"
relationship.

The task for the lab on <strong>Wednesday</strong> was to create a music database. Right up my
street! I'm hoping to learn how to build an app to help manage my music collection - which is all in MP3
format - after this course. I don't tend to stream music from services such as Spotify, just
because I like to listen to exactly what I want and where I want; with or without an Internet
connection. I don't like the idea of Spotify (other streaming services are available) suddenly
removing music from a playlist I've taken the time to create. So that's a bit of a personal goal
for "later".

Anyway, the lab task was to create a music database containing artists and albums. We had to
write methods (otherwise known as functions - which is just a piece of code that "does
something") to add, update, display or delete artists or albums. The tricky part here was that
if you delete an artist, all albums by that album would have to be deleted automatically too.
The same goes for albums - if you delete all albums by an artist, that artist had to go. This is
why the tables have to talk to each other, because otherwise they'd become horribly out of sync!
When I got home, I decided to import a portion of my music collection into the database to test
it out. That took longer than I thought it would. I suppose I wanted to validate it, by giving
it a real world use.<br>
I might add that it took me twice as long to get home because there was a concert on in Princes
St gardens, as part of the Edinburgh Fringe festival. Rag 'n' Bone Man, I'm told. I usually
cut through the gardens to get to CodeClan, but they were closed off. The buses also struggled
to get through because Princes Street was mobbed. It made for a <em>very</em> long day.

On <strong>Thursday</strong>, we moved on to "many to many" databases. The first example we
worked through was a sort of "Trip Advisor"-style database. A location would have many visitors,
and a visitor would have many locations that they've visited. Behind the scenes, you need 3
tables - one for locations, one for visitors, and one in the middle (visits) to link them. The
tricky part was to get to the location table from the visitor table or vice versa, by using
something known as "joins" on the tables. It was a tricky concept at first, but it made sense
once we'd been through it in the afternoon lab.

  <p>
I must say I was very tired by the time I got
home. It was "no homework" night, but for me it was straight to bed and don't pass go.

I arrived fully recharged and full of vigor on <strong>Friday</strong>. No need for coffee, so
I had some mint tea while the homework was handed out. There is a whiteboard at the back of the
classroom where we can write down anything we'd like to go over again on Friday, but so far we
haven't needed to do that.
</p>
<p>
There was a talk at noon from
<a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">National Records of Scotland</a>, which
was very interesting. They handle birth, death and marriage certificates; as well as the
national census which takes place every decade. They hold records dating back to the 12th
century, so you can imagine digitization is high on the agenda for them these days.<br>
There were a couple of questions asked by students at the end, which sparked a
discussion about the pros and cons of working in the public sector; as opposed to the private
sector. Their director of IT was there, and he told us that he took a considerable pay cut when
he left Tesco to join them, and that he has no regrets because he enjoys his job more now.
That's very much how I feel - I want to do something I'm passionate about.

Homework for the weekend was similar to what we've been doing for most of the week. This time we
had to build a cinema, with films and customers. We'd use cinema tickets to connect the two, and
the homework extensions involved adding screening times. That was the most challenging part
because - for the first time - we were using more than 3 tables in the database. And that's a
wrap for <strong>week 3</strong>!

      <p><strong>Monday</strong> was a break from the norm this week. Our laptops were cast
        aside and replaced with a notepad and pen, to learn all about "UX". UX means "User
        Experience", and it's about considering what the user, well, <em>experiences</em> when
        using your software. The most obvious part of that is the usability - is it clear what to
        click on, how to find things etc. It should be intuitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond that - and perhaps more
        importantly - is the consideration of people who might have a disability. The most common
        example would be sight. So, make sure font sizes aren't too small (or that there is some way
        for the user to increase the size). It's common sense, really.<br>

      Then there are other important accessibility concerns. Blind or partially sighted users
      might use a screen reader, which is software that reads out what's on the screen. If
      there is no order or structure to your content, it will make no sense to them when read
      out loud. Deaf people can't hear audible alerts or messages. People with reduced motor
      functions might take a longer time to type things or move the mouse. One of the examples
      we were given was prompting the user to enter their password or email address twice. It's
      annoying for most users, but much worse than that for others.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The final message of the day was that everyone in the software development chain should
      be thinking about UX - not just the design team. I completely agree!</p>

      <p>We were straight back at it on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, getting closer to a full
        stack web app. In other words - a webpage which sends or retrieves data from a
        database. We were introduced to Sinatra, which was apparently named after
        <a href="http://sinatrarb.com/about.html" target="_blank">Frank</a>. </p>
        <p>Sinatra is a
        lightweight web framework which acts as the bridge between the webpage and database.
        It's lightweight in terms of its size and ease of use, but with perhaps limited
        functionality. It's used on the Apple website, as well as Github, LinkedIn and BBC. I
        particularly like the 404 error page (page not found)!</p>

      <p>For the homework task, we were to create a simple
        <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Rock,-Paper,-Scissors" target="_blank">rock/paper/scissors</a>
        web-based game using Ruby and Sinatra. There was essentially two parts to this - getting
        the game logic into code and translating that into a web app. The first part was trickier
        than you might think, for such a simple premise! Once I'd cracked that, the app was very
        straightforward so I had a bit of fun with it. Retro gamers might spot the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj9p9gaUpX0" target="_blank">inspiration</a> for
        the design...</p>

      <p>It was more of the same on <strong>Wednesday</strong> - Ruby and Sinatra that is - and we
        returned to the Pizza Shop model we'd been practicing on during the previous week. Of
        course this time we could order a pizza through the webpage, rather than just on the "back end" of
        a database. Well, I guess you wouldn't sell many pizzas if your customers had to learn
        basic programming before they could order.<br>

      This was to be our last hands-on practice run, before our first project at the end of the
      week...</p>

      <p>There was a bit of a change in the air on <strong>Thursday</strong>, as everyone knew
        we were to receive our project brief by the end of the day. I must admit I was a little
        excited, to put into practice everything we'd learned over the first 4 weeks. Before we
        got to that, we were shown a simple "Zombies" web app which listed zombies, victims,
        and who bit who. You could add a "biting" as well, by selecting a zombie and a victim.
        Isn't that what everyone wants in a web app?!</p>
<p>
      The reason we were shown that was to give us an idea of what we're aiming for on our
      projects. It wasn't so much what you could see or do on the webpage, but what was going
      on beneath the bonnet.<br>

      And then, finally, we were assigned our projects! Well, I say assigned, but we were given
      choices and got to pick one. The choices were:<p>

      <ul>

      <li>A shop stock/inventory management app</li>

      <li>A museum or art gallery exhibition management app</li>
      <li>A gym members management app</li>
      <li>A personal spending tracker app</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I opted for the gym members management app, partly because my brother is thinking
        about opening his own gym. I already had a rough idea of what to include in the app.</p>
      <p>As much as we were all keen to get started on <strong>Friday</strong>, we were
        strongly encouraged to avoid coding anything until we had spent at least a day planning
        the project. Apparently 1 hour of planning saves 4 hours of coding. We decided to split
        into groups for the initial planning, so I sat with the other 3 students who picked the
        gym project and we thrashed out the basic outline together.</p>
      <p>We also had a quick lesson on managing change, which was interesting. It revolved
        around the terms "success" and "failure", and what they mean to you. We were shown this
        <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve/transcript?language=en" target="_blank">video</a>,
        and the gist of it is that you shouldn't think you've failed. You should think you
        haven't succeeded yet.</p>
      <p>After that, I disappeared into the weekend with my project, which is shaping up pretty
        well at this point. In fact, Im posting this blog entry a day later than usual, because I
        prioritised the project. More on that very soon!</p>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>Week 5 was solo project week, which I had been looking forward to. It was a chance to
          put everything together in one fully functional app. Well, that was the aim, at least.
          I'd spent the weekend getting the crux of it together, and I was well on schedule by
          Monday morning. The objective was to create a web-based app which would allow a gym
          manager to manage the members and classes running at the gym. More specifically,
          they'd need to see a list of all gym members and a list of all classes. They should also
          be able to update details for any member or class, delete them entirely, or add/remove
          a member from a class.

        </p>
</div>
</div>
        <div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-7">
        <p>

        Sounds easy enough, doesn't it? In the previous week, we were taught to create links
        on the main page to redirect to a separate page in order to create a new member/class,
        another page to update an existing one, and another page to delete. The reason for
        this is because it conforms to an accepted convention called
        <a href="https://medium.com/@atingenkay/restful-routes-what-are-they-8fe221521bb" target="_blank">Restful routes</a>.
        I won't go into detail on that here, but it is considered good practice to lay out the
        structure of your web app according to this convention. However, the user doesn't
        notice any difference at the "front end". What they <em>do</em> notice is the number
        of clicks it takes to complete a task; and for that reason I wasn't happy with
        separate pages to create, update or delete. I wanted a one-page app - or as close to
        that as possible.</p>
        <p>

        We were allowed to manage our own time throughout the week - although we still had to
        attend as normal. In other words, we weren't allowed to do it all at home. I did most
        of it at home anyway, as I found I was more productive. I'm not quite sure why that is
        though, to be honest. Some of us did get together in the mornings to discuss progress
        and share ideas and pitfalls to avoid. Otherwise, it was a matter of getting the head
        down and getting on with it!

        On <strong>Wednesday</strong>, we all had a 1 to 1 with the UX (User Experience)
        instructor. This was largely informal, and the purpose was to receive guidance and a
        few pointers on our apps. The advice given to me was to simplify it a bit. I had tried
        to maximise the use of horizontal screen space to avoid scrolling, but apparently that
        shouldn't be a concern at this stage. I'm not sure I entirely agree with that, but I
        put my faith in the resident expert!
        </p>
        <p>We all had another 1 to 1 with an instructor on <strong>Thursday</strong> too, which
          was a code review this time. This would have been a bad time to find out if anything was
          drastically wrong with it. Fortunately, it was all approved, but I did receive a few
          tips about using validation at the front end. More specifically, when a user completes a
          form on the app, there should be checks to make sure the data they're entering makes
          sense. Even more specifically, this includes ensuring there are no blank fields, numbers
          are within a specified range, and that a valid email address has been entered
          (although it only really checks for "@" in the middle).

          <q>Always explain, never feign</q>
        <p>
        On <strong>Friday</strong>, it was time to present our projects to the rest of the class.
        We had 10 minutes to talk through the project and demo the app, and 5 minutes to answer any
        questions. There are 18 students in the class, so it took the best part of the day. To
        add a bit of fun to proceedings, we were allowed to pick a song to play as we got up
        to present. I picked the theme tune to
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1o3koTLWM" target="_blank">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>,
        just to lighten the mood a bit! Those who didn't choose a song were
        assigned random kids TV show themes - I think "Thunderbirds" and "Bananas In Pyjamas"
        were chosen for them.
        </p>
        <p>
        I was up second from last, and by that time everyone looked a little weary and less
        questions were being asked at the end of the presentations. I'm not sure whether this
        was a good thing or not! I do have presenting experience so I was quite prepared and
        confident, but I've never had to demo code before. It was quite a challenge switching
        between the working app and the code behind it, to demonstrate what was actually going on.
        I couldn't really gauge whether everyone understood what I was showing them; they were
        all very quiet by this point for reasons mentioned previously. Anyway, I believe we
        are going to be taught "how to present tech" soon, so that should be of great help.
        </p>
        <p>The final app is up and running at
          <a href="https://urgym.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://urgym.herokuapp.com/</a>,

          Next week is Javascript, which I'm <em>really</em> looking forward to.</p>

        <p>In week 6, we really started to pick up the pace. It was a fresh start and an introduction to Javascript;
          which I do have some experience in. We covered the basics on <strong>Monday</strong> - namely
          variables, loops, arrays, objects and functions. These are essentially the core building blocks of
          most programming languages. It makes it easier to pick up a new language once you know the principles
          behind them, as you just need to learn how these principles are applied. I guess it's similar
          to linguistics - most languages use verbs, nouns, adjectives. You just have to know how to use
          them and string them together.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-7">
        <p>
        We also touched on scope, which means that if you have a piece of code (ie. a variable or a
        function), it may or may not be accessible to the rest of the program. It's difficult to think of an
        analogy to explain this in real terms! Maybe it's a little bit like ordering a meal in a restaurant.
        You have access to the waiter, but you wouldn't usually have access to the chef. The waiter does have
        access to the chef though, so when you order a meal, you're indirectly requesting it from the chef.
        This is similar to a function in Javascript, you ask the function to give you something, but you don't
        have access to the code inside the function. You just get the output from it. In the restaurant/chef
        scenario, the code inside the function is the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
        The homework was a "whodunnit" exercise, where you had to use your knowledge of scope, and what could
        access what. You could then deduce who the murderer was! It was a clever exercise, and good fun too.

        On <strong>Tuesday</strong>, we learned about constructors and prototypes, which sound complicated but
        are really Javascript's implementation of "classes". I mentioned before that classes are like
        blueprints, which define what an object should do. We also learned about Behaviour Driven Development
        (BDD), which is very similar to Test Driven Development (TDD). The concept is quite simple - you start
        with a behaviour that your program should have. For example - "it should return the square root of a
        number". You then write the code to satisfy that condition. We used a framework called Mocha to
        achieve this. I've no idea why it's called that, I'm guessing the developers who created it were fans
        of the drink!
        </p>
        <p>
        The task for the homework was to write code for a dinosaur park. This would determine the most popular
        dinosaurs, daily and annual revenue etc. We were given the behaviour tests - such as "it should
        calculate the total visitors per year". Then we were to write the code to achieve that.

        By <strong>Wednesday</strong>, we were on to enumeration. This was much the same as we'd covered
        previously in Ruby, with a slightly different syntax. Enumeration is essentially a way to iterate or
        loop through a collection of objects. There are several different methods, but they're all essentially
        based on the basic "forEach" loop. It does what it says on the tin - for each object: do something.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Thursday</strong> started with an introduction to events, which in this context are things
        that happen on the webpage. For example, every time something is clicked, or even hovered over, it
        can be used to trigger an event. This is something we're all familiar with these days as websites
        have become more interactive. Whenever someone clicks/hovers/types into a webpage and something
        changes, this is most likely handled by a Javascript event.
        </p>
        <p>
        It got me to thinking about how many websites would break if Javascript was disabled. Probably quite
        a few! Although I had a look into how many people browse the Internet with Javascript disabled, and it turns
        out it's a very low percentage - in the region of 1%.

        <p>That was pretty much it for the week. We got our homework on Friday morning, followed by a
          presentation from the Codeclan CEO about "how to present tech". This was reasonably useful,
          although most of it was centred around how to present in general. Knowing who your audience are is
          vital, in any case.<br>
        As things weren't too hectic, I took a trip up to Morningside to have lunch with my old workmates in
        the Astley Ainslie canteen. It was great to see them, it somehow seems like longer than 6 weeks
        since I saw them last. I got back to Codeclan in time to see the graduation presentation for Cohort
        E22. I was impressed by the camaraderie within their group, they seem to have bonded well. Our
        cohort hasn't reached that level yet, I wondered if we would by the end of the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          The homework for the weekend involved making a one page app which presented the user with a
          form, and then output everything on that form to a window. It was to be a list of items with a
          dropdown menu of some sort. I decided to create a "playlist maker", which allows you to submit a
          music playlist and each playlist would be added to the page. It was relatively easy, to be honest.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was it for the week, although I got the distinct impression that things were starting to ramp
          up in difficulty. Which is, of course, a good thing.

          We didn't realise it on <strong>Monday</strong>, but we were about to embark on one of the most
          difficult weeks of the course. "Notoriously difficult", we were told later! Incidentally, I don't
          think I've mentioned that we are the first cohort to be taught Javascript <em>before</em> Java - every
          other cohort to date has been taught Java first (that's 30 cohorts prior to us, in case you're
          wondering). I'm not sure why it was changed, but I actually don't mind as I've used Javascript
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
        So, the first thing on the agenda was a modular pattern known as "PubSub". We covered "events" in the
        previous week, which are things that happen on the webpage - such as a click or scroll event. The
        idea behind PubSub is to split your code up into areas which publish events, and areas which
        subscribe to published events. Let's say you had a text input that you fill out, click a button,
        and then that text appears on the page. PubSub allows you to publish that text as an event, which
        your code can subscribe to and output it to the page. It involves splitting your code up across
        multiple files, all of which have to talk to each other. We were wondering if it was worth the
        effort; when we could easily do the same thing in a single file! We were assured that when you scale
        up your apps into more complexity, the PubSub pattern really starts to pay off.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Tuesday</strong> was more of the same really, just practicing the use of PubSub, getting
        used to the pattern and trying to get past all the frustrating errors and mismatches it brings
        about. By the end of the day, I think I had it down. I couldn't write all the code without
        referring to a previous example; but I did understand what the code was doing. That's the main
        thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, a big part of coding involves regular searches on the Internet. Sometimes it's
        just a quick search to check the syntax, which is slightly different for each programming language.
        At other times, you have an idea of what you want to achieve, and you just need to find out which
        tools (functions or methods) are available for you to achieve it.

        Things got a little more exciting on <strong>Wednesday</strong>, when we were introduced to APIs.
        API stands for
        <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82" target="_blank">Application Programming Interface</a>.
        I think the last word - interface - describes them best. Basically, that's what they are -
        interfaces provided for you to connect to another application. In actual fact, most people will be
        more familiar with them than they might think. If you've ever been on a webpage and noticed a Facebook
        or Twitter feed integrated into it - that's achieved by using an API.<br>

        Our first attempt at connecting via an API involved retrieving information about the countries of the
        world, and then filtering through it to find regions, continents etc. This information is provided for
        free at <a href="https://restcountries.eu/" target="_blank">https://restcountries.eu/</a>. I have
        no idea why it's provided for free, but we were all as grateful as we were impressed. There are
        actually loads of free APIs you can use, as we were to discover later. Anyway, we were able to
        connect to the API, retrieve the full list of countries; and then filter that on the webpage
        in order to display a particular country and the associated information. We even managed to get the
        flag of that country to display as an image. One of my classmates told me that she showed it to her
        grandchildren when she got home, and that they were thoroughly entertained by it! That's actually quite
        something, in this world full of apps and on-demand content.
        </p>
        <p>
        By <strong>Thursday</strong>, we were all fairly well acquainted with both PubSub and APIs, I
        think. There was one more topic to cover this week, which was a fairly new Javascript feature
        called "promises". These are related to requests made to APIs, and are quite aptly named. They're
        used to execute code once a response has been received from an API. Clearly, a response won't be
        received instantly, unless you have a super fast connection. Even then, there will be a small
        delay. Javascript is an asynchronous language, which essentially means that it doesn't wait for
        one line of code to complete before moving on to the next. This is, of course, a good thing. As
        Javascript is mainly used for webpages, you can imagine how slow pages would load if it only
        processed one line of code at any one time before moving on to the next. This is also known as a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVLjh8A6OGU" target="_blank">non-blocking language</a>.
        As I said, it is a good thing, but it does make it tricky if you need lines of code to run in a
        specific and timed sequence. That's where promises help - as the next line of code related to that API
        request will run when the response from the request is received. I suppose it is exactly as it
        sounds - "I promise to do this when I get the response".
        </p>
          <q>I can move.repeat(3) any mountain</q>
        <p>
        The afternoon lab was a bit tricky. We were to connect to an API returning a collection of all the
        Munros (ie. mountains in Scotland over 3000 feet tall). That wasn't the tricky part; the challenge lay
        in trying to filter by region <em>and</em> being able to return to the unfiltered list again. We were
        paired up for this lab, and unfortunately we didn't quite complete the entire exercise. In fact, I don't
        think anybody did. It was really bugging me though, because we were so close.<br>

        I forgot to mention that a new cohort started this week - E24 - so we were no longer the newbies! As
        per our first week, we were all invited to the local pub (The Chanter) to get to know each other at
        the end of the day. I had hoped to speak to some of the new guys, but unfortunately we were assigned
        three big tables and the new cohort congregated around one table; so it was difficult to chat to
        them. Never mind, I found myself sitting next to some of the instructors, and inevitably found myself
        in the middle of a debate about which methods performed best when sorting data. Just your usual pub
        chat! I didn't stay long though - I wanted to get home to have another go at the Munros task. I did
        manage to complete it this time, which was quite satisfying.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our homework issued on <strong>Friday</strong> morning involved researching and choosing an API,
        and then creating a webpage which connects to that API. I had a quick look over a list of free
        APIs, before heading out to the main area to attend a talk from
        <a href="https://www.list.co.uk/" target="_blank">The List</a>. If you're not  familiar, they
        essentially provide a "list" of events taking place in Edinburgh and Glasgow mainly, but have
        expanded out across the UK in recent times. The gentleman presenting (I didn't catch his name) was
        one of the original founders in 1985, and I was very impressed by his passion and enthusiasm.
        There was more to it than simply listing events too. For example, the police and transport
        services subscribe to them to receive information about which events are taking place, and
        the numbers expected to attend. Hotels are also interested, to manage yield. That probably explains
        why hotel prices shoot up whenever something is happening in that area on a particular date.<br>
        He mentioned that they're looking for staff who would be a good fit there (ie. "List-y").
        Apparently, one of the questions they ask at interviews is which event you last attended.

        After lunch, we had a Q&A session with one of Codeclan's senior developers. It was intended to give
        us industry insights, as well as careers advice. He was really friendly, and the whole thing was
        very informal. I was surprised to hear that we should apply for <em>all</em> jobs, regardless of
        the languages used within that company. During this course, we focus on Ruby, Java and Javascript,
        but we only spend a few weeks on each. I guess it follows that we have the potential to pick up
        another language fairly quickly. C# was mentioned, which is a language used in Windows environments.
        I have some experience with C#, so I may revisit it at the end of the course; depending on how things
        are going of course. There was also the inevitable discussion about salaries, which I'm never
        completely comfortable with. I don't think any of us should be focussing on that at this stage, but
        at the same time; there is no avoiding it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Back to the homework - I settled on a <a href="http://numbersapi.com/" target="_blank">Numbers API</a>.
        My reasoning was that there are a lot of things you can do with numbers, and they can be manipulated
        within your code. When you pass the API a number, it returns a fact associated with that number. You
        can also pass it a date, year, or ask it to pick a random number. It was all straightforward enough
        to link it to a webpage - apart from the date. You provide it a date in the format day/month, but it
        returns it in the format of day of the year. For example, 28/2 would be returned as 59. I had to
        write some code to convert it back to day/month again, in order to display that on the page. <br>
        Anyway, if you'd like to have a look, it's <a href="./numbers.html" target="_blank">here</a>. See if
        you can spot the bug which occurs when you use months with less than 31 days...

        databases, in order to make our apps "full stack".

      <p>
      Week 8, and I should start by saying it's
      been such a busy week! As mentioned previously, we started on <strong>Monday</strong> by looking at
      "back-end" Javascript functionality. In other words - the database and associated components that
      allow the app to save and load data. Everything we've done so far with Javascript exists in the
      browser only. If you refresh or close the page - everything is wiped and reset.
      </p>
      <p>
      We began the day with an introduction to <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>.
      This is a Javascript web app framework, which, in a nutshell, enables us to easily connect the
      front-end (everything in the browser) and the back-end (database - more on that shortly!).<br>
      Express allows you to "listen" for requests on your server. This is what happens on <em>all</em> web
      servers - they are in a permanent state of listening for requests from clients (ie. users navigating
      to a webpage in the browser). This wasn't too taxing, so we quickly moved on to the database lesson.
      We'd be using <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>, which - I'm reliably
      informed - stands for "humongous database". The biggest difference between this and SQL-based
      databases is that this one isn't relational. Everything in it is stored as a key-value pair, such
      as "name: Deborah" or "colour: red" etc. I'm over-simplifying it of course, but that's the principle
      behind it.<br>
      I should add that when I mention running a database and server - it's all running on the same
      computer in this case. You just configure your browser to point to it locally. This is for learning
      purposes only - it wouldn't make much sense to do that in a real-world scenario!
      </p>
      <p>
      The homework for the night was to review a sample codebase for an app, which uses Express and
      MongoDB to connect a front-end webpage. A lot of it was new and quite daunting. I had to do a
      bit of research to try to figure out what some of the code was doing.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-7">
      <p>
      We started on <strong>Tuesday</strong> with a review of the homework after standup, and I was
      relieved to discover I wasn't the only one who didn't understand all of it. We then revisited the concept
      of Restful routes, which is a convention used to organise server requests according to their purpose.
      Most requests are known as GET requests, which "get" information back from a webpage. Then there are
      POST requests, most often used when submitting a form on a webpage. There are also PUT (update)
      requests, which are used when an existing item on a webpage is edited and submitted. And then there
      are DELETE requests, which are self-explanatory!
      </p>
      <p>
      We had a paired lab in the afternoon which again involved taking an existing codebase; only this
      time it wasn't fully functional. We were to review the code and make the necessary changes to get
      the app working. The app was a webpage which allowed birdwatchers to create, edit and delete
      "sightings". We managed to sort the code out, but although we checked it and double checked it; the
      app still didn't work. I later found out that it was because we opened the webpage directly from the
      file on the computer; rather than requesting it from the server running on the computer. These
      mistakes are infuriating at the time, but I guess they're all part of the learning.
      </p>
      <p>
      We didn't have any homework that night, but I decided to tinker with the birdwatcher app to get it
      working properly. I knew it would annoy me if I didn't see it through.

      On <strong>Wednesday</strong>, we had another lab. This one would last all day, and again it was a
      paired lab. The task was to build a full-stack app from scratch - front-end and back-end. This was a
      big ask, and the difficulty depended on whether you challenged yourselves to do it from memory or
      refer to notes. Well, it was impossible to do it <em>all</em> from memory, but we decided to refer to
      notes only when we got stuck. Which was quite often, as it turned out!<br>
      The objective was to build a "Bucket List" app. It should allow you to create or delete bucket list
      items, and mark them as complete if they'd been done. We decided to go a step further, and allow the
      details of the bucket list item to be updated too. This proved to be a very difficult thing to
      achieve, as it involved making each item a form rather than just a read-only section. We didn't quite
      get it finished within class time, and my lab partner persuaded me to hang back afterwards to finish it.
      I was quite anxious to get home because there was a heavy storm outside. Roads were being closed
      and trains cancelled. I found out later that an entire
      <a href="https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/our-region/edinburgh/storm-ali-a-recap-of-the-damage-and-disruption-in-edinburgh-and-the-lothians-1-4802970" target="_blank">windscreen blew off the front of a bus</a>
      too! However, the draw of finishing the app proved too much; so I stayed behind and we managed to
      finish it.
      </p>
      <p>
        By <strong>Thursday</strong>, there was an air of anxiety, excitement and anticipation setting in
        ahead of project week. I must say I was surprised when other members of my cohort told me that they
        were getting nervous, I couldn't really understand that. There is no "pressure", as such, and no minimum
        standard or benchmark - you just do the best you can. I don't know if they were perhaps considering that
        the project may be part of their final portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Thursday morning, we re-visited Git and advanced Git commands. We've been using Git since day 1 as
        a version control system, and our daily homework is pushed up to Github so that the instructors can
        review it there. However, we are going to be working in groups over the coming week, so we'd need to
        learn how to use Git collaboratively. We have to avoid overwriting changes made to the project by our
        team members, and we have to keep a stable version of the project which we can revert back to if it all
        goes wrong!
      </p>
        <q>There's an app for that...</q>
      <p>
        Following the Git lesson, we were ceremonially sorted into our groups. We were asked to stand at the
        back of the classroom, and the instructors marked 5 tables for the groups. Our names were read out one
        at a time, along with which group we were to go to. There are 18 students in our class, so we ended up
        with groups of 3 or 4. I was in a group of 4, which might sound like an advantage but I'm not sure
        that it necessarily is! It would require a larger degree of coordination and communication, as we were to
        discover very soon...
      </p>
      <p>
        The project briefs were announced next. We were to choose one as a team, although we could deviate from it
        slightly if approved by an instructor. The available briefs were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Education app</strong> - an interactive web app which displays information about a topic</li>
        <li><strong>CO2 Calculator app</strong> - an interactive app which generates a carbon footprint score</li>
        <li><strong>Browser game</strong> - an interactive game based on a traditional board or table game</li>
        <li><strong>Stocks/shares app</strong> - an interactive app which shows stock or share values</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After lunch, we got together as a group to decide what we were going to do and how we were going to achieve
        it. I was open to any of the briefs really, but probably a little more keen on the game or CO2 calculator.
        They were a little different from any of the previous labs we'd worked on. My teammates were in agreement,
        and we voted unanimously to take on the browser game. One of the teams in the previous cohort (E22) had
        attempted a version of Scrabble, and we all agreed that it was impressive!
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we had to decide on which game to code. I suggested Play Your Cards Right (based on the TV show),
        and my teammates suggested Minesweeper, Snakes and Ladders, and Trivial Pursuit. We settled on Trivial Pursuit,
        largely because we knew of a
        <a href="https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=20&category=" target="_blank">quiz questions API</a>
        which could provide the questions for us. The challenging part would be to create an interactive board,
        and then integrate that with the quiz questions and overall game flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this stage, we needed a proof of concept so that we knew we would be able to achieve it. If we were
        biting off more than we could chew, we had to know before the weekend so that we could switch to something
        else. With that in mind, I went home and spent the evening working on the board logic. Without it, the
        game was literally a bust!

        I arrived on <strong>Friday</strong> morning bearing good news - we had a board prototype. We'd agreed
        that the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) should be a one-way track around a board, with questions of
        different categories on each square. I created the track using a layout method called CSS grid,
        and used Javascript to manipulate the position of the "board piece" around it. If you want to see
        it, it's <a href="./css_board_test/css_board_test.html" target="_blank">here</a> - although there
        isn't much to it.<br>
        Secretly, I would have been disappointed if we didn't achieve a more complex board layout.
      </p>
      <p>
        We spent the rest of the day thrashing out plans on paper and
        <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a>, which is an online tool to help organise
        your workload and tasks. It allows your whole team to log in individually, to create, edit or
        delete tasks.

      <p>We decided to meet again on <strong>Sunday</strong> at a local coffee shop, as the Codeclan building
        is usually closed on Sundays. We hit our first snag at that point. When we parted on Friday, we
        hadn't been clear enough about which tasks we were all picking up over the weekend. This led to
        both myself and one of my teammates working on the board, which was time wasted. Never mind! Time
        was still on our side....

  <p>
    It didn't feel like a new week on <strong>Monday</strong>, as we'd all been working through the weekend and it
      was a continuation of the previous week. By this point, we had a working board which a single board piece
      could move around (clockwise only), and a question set of 6 different categories - books, history, music etc.
      We also had a graphic of a "pie", which is a circle with 6 triangles inside it. The intention was to use this
      as a representation of the player's score. The game will be won when a player has 6 pieces of pie.
  </p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-7">
  <p>
    We had our MVP completed mid-afternoon. This was a one-way board, with different categories on each square. When the
    piece lands on a square, a quiz question is loaded. If answered wrongly, the play switches to the other player.
    There is no way to win the game at this point! We decided that it won't be necessary for the MVP.
  </p>
  <p>
    As mentioned previously, I was really keen to have a non-linear board, so I took that task on on Monday
    evening. We'd talked about having a circular board too, as in the traditional game; but decided against it
    at this point because it wasn't a realistic goal given the timeframe. The non-linear board was an outside
    track with a "cross" in the middle to allow players to cut across the board.
  </p>

  <p>
    I attempted to work this out programmatically, but I couldn't find a reliable and suitable algorithm to do it.
    I decided instead to map the board out, with each square assigned coordinates. These coordinates could
    then be used by the board piece to set the position. I also wanted to give the player the available
    board "move options" after rolling the die. I achieved this by mapping routes to each square, for a given
    number between 1 and 6. This was a very laborious and painstaking task. There are 33 squares, with 6 sets
    of routes to define for each one. Once it was done, doors would be opened to further functionality. The
    knowledge of this spurred me on!
  </p>
  <p>
    We were well placed by <strong>Tuesday</strong>, with a semi-working game in the bag. It had to be finished
    by Thursday though, so I was conscious of time. We had to figure out how to make it multiplayer
    (2/3/4 players), and we still didn't have any way for a player to actually win. We also wanted to add a
    timer in, so that one player couldn't stay at the board indefinitely if they kept answering the questions
    correctly. If truth be told, I was against this idea! It happens in other games such as snooker; if a
    player is good enough to stay at the table and clear up. I relented to the will of my team though.
  </p>
  <p>
    I spent Tuesday evening working on the addition of 3 and 4 player functionality. This was quite
    challenging. Up to now, the game logic worked by assuming that if player 1 isn't at the board, then player 2
    is. It now had to be re-written to cycle through the players. I also had to put a block on someone entering
    player 1, 2 and 4 at the start screen. I'm not sure why they would, but if they did it would break it!
  </p>
    <q>Pie in the Sky</q>
  <p>
    I managed to get that done by <strong>Wednesday</strong>, and my teammates had added the timer as well as
    jazzing up the look of the game. I'd also added an instructions/"how to play" dropdown to the game, which
    could be toggled open or closed by clicking on a button. When I showed it to the rest of the team, they  voted
    against that being available "in-play"; so I moved it to the start screen. One of my teammates had also
    added some cool fade-out and fade-in effects to the start screen and end screen, and a database connection
    was made later in the afternoon to include a highscores/leaderboard table on the end screen.<br>
    And that was it! We were all quite pleased with the final result.

    Unfortunately, I would miss the presentations on <strong>Thursday</strong> as I'd planned a trip down
    south to visit friends and family over the weekend. I'd have liked to have seen some of the other teams'
    apps, as well as co-presenting our app of course. The presentations take place in the main area rather
    than in our classroom, so that anyone can watch them. Our cohort (E24) were presenting in the morning,
    and the previous cohort (E23) were to present in the afternoon. This was the first time that two cohorts
    were on the same module (Javascript) at the same time. E23 were a few weeks ahead of us, having done the
    Java module, which is why they were to present after us I believe.

    My teammates decided to prank me by telling me that the presentation was a disaster as the quiz
    questions API went down. This would break the game, and I fell for it because it had gone down once
    or twice while we were developing the app. In fact, we'd discussed making an offline backup version,
    but didn't have time to implement it.<br>
    They eventually put me out of my misery - the presentation was a success!

      Amazingly, we're into week 10 already. The last few weeks have flashed by, especially in comparison
      with the first few weeks which were relatively slow paced. This week, we'd be taking a step back from
      coding and preparing ourselves for life after CodeClan. In other words - thinking about getting a
      job.
      </p>
      <p>
      We had a later start on <strong>Monday</strong>, which suited me as I was down south over the weekend
      visiting friends and family; and had only travelled back on Sunday afternoon/evening. We started with
      an "industry insights" lesson, which centred around
      what to expect from a typical interview for a tech-based job. We didn't go into general interview
      techniques, and instead discussed technical interviews and what might be asked of you. Apparently,
      it's not unusual to be given a task to carry out. You might even be paired up with someone on the
      interview panel, to assess how you work as part of a team. This might have seemed a little odd before
      I started this course, but it's not a strange concept now as we're often paired up in class to
      complete lab tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
      In the spirit of that, we were split into small groups, assigned a task and given about 15-20 minutes
      to complete it. The task was to draw up plans to code the board game "Monopoly". I immediately
      thought back to our group project the previous week - Trivial Pursuit - which would help with the
      movement around the board. However, upon re-familiarising ourselves with the Monopoly rules, we
      quickly realised how complex the game is! There are little caveat rules in there - such as going to
      jail if you roll a double 6 twice in a row. Despite that, I think we made a decent attempt at mapping
      it out.
      </p>
      <p>
      We spent the rest of the lesson going through some technical questions you might be asked at an
      interview. I realised that we didn't really cover much of the computer science "theory" in the
      course, as it's more about hands-on programming. This was an area I knew I'd have to improve on by
      myself in my spare time.
      </p>
        <q>Gis a job, I can do that</q>
      <p>
      We spent <strong>Tuesday</strong> going over our CV prep, and talking about
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. We discussed the pros and cons of LinkedIn,
      and concluded that it's largely down to how you use it. The more active you are, the more visible you
      are. Not all of us are entirely comfortable with self-marketing. I was pleased to hear that writing a
      blog can be helpful - I'm glad I took the time to do it now!
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Wednesday</strong> was short and sweet, as it consisted mainly of an industry insights talk
      from the CodeClan CEO. She'd asked everyone on Friday to pick a local tech company and then do some
      research on them. Specifically - find out about their staffing, turnover/profits, funding, where
      they're based and what they do. I wasn't in on Friday, so I observed the findings of my classmates.
      The underlying lesson here was to do your homework on a potential employer, to find out if you're a
      good fit for each other. There's a big difference between a local startup company with just a few
      employees, and a large organisation with several branches and hundreds or thousands of employees on
      their books. There are potentially advantages and disadvantages for both - it depends what is
      important to you.
      </p>
      <p>
      The talk ended with a video about combatting "imposter syndrome", and how to improve your confidence.
      That's not something that has or will affect me I shouldn't think, but it definitely did when I was
      a little younger and less experienced. I'm one of the (slightly) older students in the class - most are
      in their twenties.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-7">
      <p>
      On <strong>Thursday</strong>, we talked again about job applications and when to start them. The
      timing is actually quite tricky, because applying for jobs is actually very time consuming and it
      would affect your ability to get the most out of the course. A few of my classmates have started
      already, but I want to focus on the course to learn as much as I can while I have the chance. I
      remember how difficult it was to work full-time and study at the same time, and I always said I would
      maximise the opportunity to learn when I returned to full time education.
      </p>
      <p>
      We had some mock interviews with the instructors in the afternoon, which were entirely technical
      questions. It was a little awkward, as we were in that weird zone between pretending to be in an
      interview situation and the relaxed/informal relationship we usually have! It was a very useful
      exercise though. I found that although I knew the answers, I couldn't quite put it neatly into words.
      It was a little frustrating, but then it touches on the theory side of it that I mentioned earlier in
      this post.

      There was a lot going on on <strong>Friday</strong>. First of all, it was CodeClan's 3rd anniversary
      - cue oodles of balloons and banners. There was a party planned that evening in a local bar to
      celebrate, which I immediately ruled myself out of going to because I had a 40th birthday party to go
      to on Saturday; two parties in a weekend would be too much for me at this moment in time!
      </p>
      <p>
      Besides that, we all had our PDA exams to sit on Friday morning. I haven't really mentioned the PDA
      yet, which is the <a href="https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/16759.html" target="_blank">Professional
        Development Award</a>. It's included as part of the course, and most of it involves collecting
        evidence to demonstrate that you understand software development principles. It typically consists of a
        screenshot of some code, including an explanation of what the code does. I'm not sure if the PDA is
        widely recognised to be honest. The way I see it, employers would rather see evidence of what you
        can do - and the PDA only really covers the very basics. Still, it's nice to have, and I believe
        you can use it as a base for further education - possibly at a college or university.
      </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-7">
      <p>
      The exams were split into 4 different tests, which we did in one session. We all had to log in to an
      online portal to sit them, under formal exam conditions. This was very strange compared to the usual
      informal setting of the classroom. You're allowed 45 minutes per exam, but I think we all completed
      them within about 90 minutes.  I found out later that I passed them all. This was a bit of a relief
      because I didn't want a resit hanging over me; not least because of the time it would take. The
      requirements and tasks for the PDA aren't overly challenging, but it is all very time consuming.
      </p>
      <p>
      There wasn't anything else on the agenda for the day. The main area was out of bounds because of a speed
      networking event for Cohort E23 - we'll be doing that ourselves in a few weeks! Representatives for
      CodeClan's partners come in to speak to students with a view to potentially offering someone a job. You get
      6 minutes to speak to each representative, before a bell is rung and you move on to the next table.
      Employers who have previously hired CodeClan students often bring them along, which is a nice touch.

      We had some more PDA tasks to complete for the weekend's homework, relating to unit testing and
      integration testing. Unit testing involves isolating a small section of code, whereas integration
      testing is about testing how two (or more) pieces of code work together. On to week 11 then, where
      we'll be starting on Java...
      </p>

<div id="w11" class="blog-panel">
<div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p>
      Week 11 was to be the first week of Java, and we made a start on <strong>Monday</strong> by going over
      the differences between Java and other languages we'd used; such as Ruby and JavaScript. Java is a
      <a href="https://hackernoon.com/i-finally-understand-static-vs-dynamic-typing-and-you-will-too-ad0c2bd0acc7" target="_blank">statically typed</a>
      language, which means that you have to declare the types of variables as well as the values. That is
      to say, if you want to use an integer - you have to state that it's an integer before using it. Ruby is a lot
      more forgiving as it determines the type of something for you.
      </p>
      <p>
      After that, we spent some time setting up IntelliJ, which is an IDE (Integrated Development
      Environment). Up to now we'd been using Atom, which is essentially a jazzed up text editor adapted
      for coding. An IDE is a bit more than that - it has built-in tools such as debugging, testing and
      built/compile tools. You need an IDE to get the best out of Java because Java code needs to be
      compiled. The compiler translates the source code (the code you've typed) into code which can be
      executed by the computer (assembly code, or machine code).
      </p>
      <p>
      We spent the rest of the day going over the basics of Java. Again, the principles are much the same
      as other languages. It's becoming a familiar pattern!
      </p>
      <p>
      Our homework consisted of some fairly basic tasks involving setting up classes, for a water bottle,
      calculator and printer. The bottle and printer have properties (capacity, toner, paper etc), whereas
      the calculator only has methods (add, subtract, multiple, divide). It was all straight forward enough.
      In fact, I got most of it done on the bus journey home.
      </p>
      <p>We moved on to more familiar concepts on <strong>Tuesday</strong> - collections. Again, much the
        same as in other languages. Arrays, hash maps and array lists. Arrays are fixed collections of
        things in a specific order. Hash maps are collections of things in key-value pairs, where you'd
        look up the values using the key. Array lists are slightly more flexible arrays. Basic arrays are a
        bit more rigid in Java.
      </p>
      <p>
      The afternoon lab was a repeat of a lab we'd done before in Ruby. It involved setting up a bus, bus stop and
      passengers. It was another paired lab, which I do quite enjoy. If you're paired with someone, they often
      pick up on some things that you don't, and vice versa. We had to replicate a bus
      picking up passengers from a bus stop, which increases the number of passengers on the bus whilst
      decreasing the number of people at the bus stop. This all sounds very easy, but it's that little bit
      harder to reproduce this scenario in code. I say a little bit harder, but I think we all managed it
      comfortably enough.
      </p>
      <p>
      For the homework, we had to build a library in code, which allows people to borrow books. The library
      would keep track of which books were out on loan, and each book would have its own properties such as
      its title and author. One of the challenges with object-oriented programming is deciding which
      class or object is responsible for what. For example, is the library responsible for loaning the book;
      or is the borrower responsible for borrowing it? Quite often, there isn't a right or wrong answer.
      So long as it works, and other coders can understand what you're doing.

      <strong>Wednesday</strong> was a little strange, as we were assigned an all-day lab. I say it's
      strange because I didn't think we'd covered enough at that point in the week to justify spending a
      whole day practicing in a lab. I guess it was still useful though. The brief for the lab was to build
      a hotel, which enabled you to book guests into rooms, and check them in upon arrival etc. It was another
      paired lab, and I think we made a good attempt at it. We found out afterwards that we made things
      more difficult than necessary, by trying to ensure a guest had booked before checking in. It seemed
      logical to do that, otherwise the hotel would be something like Fawlty Towers! However, the solution
      revealed after the lab finished made no differentiation between booking and checking in.

      We didn't have any homework as such, other than watching a video about IntelliJ. IntelliJ was the IDE application
      I mentioned previously. We had to learn about the debugging features built into it. It allows you to
      pause the code at any point, which is extremely useful to pinpoint any errors you might be receiving.
      Without it, you can only really look at the start point and end point of a piece of code. It might
      help to compare it to a stopcock and a tap. If you know the stopcock and tap are working, yet the pressure
      is low; you know there is probably a leak somewhere in between. IntelliJ would allow you to inspect any
      part of the pipework.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Thursday</strong> morning was interesting. We looked into the basics of algorithms, which is
      generally not something we'd be covering in the course as it's a computer science thing. An algorithm is
      a set of steps designed to achieve an output. You could write an algorithm to make a cup of tea, for
      example. It gets far more complex than that, of course, but you have to start somewhere. It is an
      area I'd like to explore after the course, if possible.
      </p>
      <p>
      We spend the afternoon learning about Enums, which are basically used as "fixed" data sets in Java.
      If the values are never going to change, you'd consider assigning them as Enums. For example - all of
      the planets of the solar system, and their respective sizes. I realise as I'm typing this that it
      might not be the best example, as Pluto was fairly recently declassified as a planet!

      We followed that with another paired lab - I can't remember having so many labs in one week. I enjoy
      them though, and this one in particular was good fun. We were tasked with creating a basic card game,
      where each player draws a card and the player with the highest card wins. The most important part of
      the lab was to practice using Enums, and as the deck of cards is fixed, we assigned it as Enums. It
      was all plain sailing once we'd figured out how to manipulate it. I had to abandon my lab partner at
      3pm as I had an appointment with CodeClan's careers advisor to go over my CV.
      </p>
      <p>
      As I mentioned the previous week, CodeClan help a lot with things like job applications, so I took
      the CV advice on board. Apparently my CV looks a little dated, and I'd probably agree with that. I
      haven't used my CV for a long time as I've worked for the NHS over the past 10 years, and they don't
      accept CVs. As such, the template I used for my CV must date back at least 5 years. I have applied for
      jobs outside of the NHS but didn't manage to escape!

      <p><strong>Friday</strong> was a busy day. We got our homework as usual in the morning. It involved
        creating an airport, with a hangar and a collection of planes. You had to create flights, and assign
        passengers to the flights. I immediately thought of my Mum when I saw the assignment, as she is a bit
        of a plane spotter! I actually have a bit of knowledge about different airports and plane models from
        listening to her talking about it. I knew it would pay off at some point...

        I managed to slip away at lunch to meet my old work colleagues at Morningside, before returning in time
        for the graduation ceremony for cohort E23. They are the cohort previous to us, which means that we are now the
        next in line to graduate. Their cohort seemed to be a close unit compared to ours, with a lot more in the
        way of camaraderie. In saying that, none of us are in it for "the banter". Although it always helps.
        Anyway, it was nice to see them off; but a little daunting to think we're next.

        I spent a lot of the weekend working on a side-project, which is a JavaScript game based on
        <a href="http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Play_Your_Cards_Right" target="_blank">Play Your Cards Right</a>.
        It was something I'd proposed during our JavaScript group projects but we decided against it. I
        decided to return to it as a solo project. I was always a fan of the TV show, and I'm hoping Bruce
        would approve of the final product if he could see it. Watch this space!

      It felt like the Java section of the course was going relatively slowly as we entered week 12. I'm sure
      weren't covering anywhere near the same amount of content as we did when we started on JavaScript. My
      theory is that since they switched the order of the course around - Java used to be before JavaScript
      - they haven't refactored the course content to increase the complexity of Java as being the "final module".
      </p>

      I didn't make it in on <strong>Monday</strong>, unfortunately, as I had bathroom/DIY issues at home.
      I decided to work through the class notes from home, which thankfully didn't take too long. We were
      introduced to the concepts of inheritance and abstraction. They form two out of the
      <a href="https://medium.com/@hamzzza.ahmed95/four-pillars-of-object-oriented-programming-oop-e8d7822aa219" target="_blank">four pillars of object-oriented programming</a>.
      Inheritance is much as it sounds. You create a class which inherits methods and properties from
      another class. You might have a car class and a motorbike class, which both inherit from a vehicle
      class. You would set the properties and methods which are common to all vehicles on the vehicle class,
      which would be inherited by the car and motorbike. They can add their own specific car and motorbike
      properties after that. The advantage is that you don't have to keep re-typing all the same "common"
      properties for a car, motorbike, van, truck etc.
      </p>
      <p>Abstraction is in principle very simple. It's really just abstracting the complexity of an app so
        that you only see the basic input and output. Of course there is a lot more to it than that; but
        that's it in a nutshell.
      </p>
      <p>
      I was back in at CodeClan on <strong>Tuesday</strong> to learn about polymorphism and interfaces.
      Polymorphism translates from latin and means "something with many forms". In the context of programming,
      it means that you can use an object as more than one type. Following on from the example above, you
      can use a car as a vehicle or a car. That doesn't really make much sense in real terms, but it's
      useful when you want to group up a lot of vehicles as a collection rather than having separate
      collections of cars, motorbikes, trucks etc.
      </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-7">
      <p>
      I suppose a better example might be a person. A person can be a father or a mother, and at other times
      they might be a bus driver, or a support worker.
      </p>
      <p>
      Interfaces are a little more tricky to understand. They allow you to place a constraint upon objects,
      in the form of an obligation they must fulfill. For example, you might have an "IMove" interface on
      an animal class. The "I" prefix is a naming convention - sticking to it is considered best practice.
      The IMove interface might say that for every animal object you create, it <em>must</em> implement a method
      which allows the animal to move. All animals can move, but they move in different ways. They might
      walk, swim or fly. So as long as each animal type derived from the animal class implements a move
      method, the interface promise is fulfilled.

      <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p>
      As I said, it is a bit tricky, and there were a few questions about why you'd use an interface at all.
      That would become clearer as the week progressed.
      </p>
      <p>
      We had a paired lab to practice inheritance next, which was based on the model of a hi-fi stereo
      system. The system is built upon a central amplifier, with every other component connecting to it.
      You might have a CD deck, radio tuner, cassette deck, record deck and whatever else you can think of.
      The idea was to consider which components shared common properties and methods. For example, most
      components would have a "play" and "stop" method. I think the only one which technically doesn't is
      the radio tuner. It makes sense then to create a top-level component class, and have all components
      inherit the shared properties and methods from it.
      </p>
      <p>
      The homework was a similar task, this time a theme park. The park would have attractions (rides,
      playground and a common park/picnic area), food and drink stalls, and visitors of course. It was
      fairly straight forward at first, to simply group the attractions and stalls together. However, the advanced
      extensions asked for restrictions on the visitor's height and age depending on which attraction or
      stall they visited. It also asked for a pricing structure, with the visitor having a limited budget.
      That threw up a few challenges which called for the use of interfaces. An ITicketed interface for the
      attractions/stalls which included a charge, and ISecurity for those with age/height restrictions. I
      found that it was the most challenging homework task we'd had for a long <time class=""></time>
      </p>
      <p>
      We started on <strong>Wednesday</strong> with a homework review, and I have to say there were a few
      grumblings in the classroom (including some from myself). The homework solution included techniques
      which we were advised not to use. I think that's why the homework was so challenging - because we
      were all trying to complete it by using the best practices that we were taught. To be fair, the
      instructors acknowledged this and said that they would review that particular homework assignment. At
      the very least, it would make it fairer for the cohort after us.
      </p>
      <p>
      Following that, we moved on to another concept known as composition. This was very simple,
      and we'd actually covered it the previous day in the stereo components lab. Composition means that you
      construct objects using other objects as components wherever possible. The advantage of this is
      fairly clear - you can swap components in and out without having to re-write the entire "container"
      object code.
      </p>
      <q>Here in my car, I feel safest of all</q>
      <p>
      It makes sense if you think of a real-world object such as a car. If a component fails, you replace
      it. You don't scrap the entire car and create a new one! The other important aspect of composition is
      something known as the
      <a href="https://hackernoon.com/you-dont-understand-the-single-responsibility-principle-abfdd005b137" target="_blank">single responsibility principle</a>.
      In the car analogy, each component would be responsible for its own function. The air filter would
      filter air, and the fuel tank would hold the fuel. I suppose that sounds very much like common sense,
      but when coding, it's tempting to combine functionality into a class or object to avoid creating another one.
      </p>
      <p>
      Talking of cars, the afternoon paired lab involved setting up a car dealership. We had to have
      different types of cars, the option to rent or buy, and customers with budgets. We also had to
      service or repair cars, as well as refuel them. We got hung up on the refueling part actually, as we weren't
      sure how to handle hybrid cars. This stemmed from a lack of knowledge about exactly how hybrid cars
      worked! We planned to use an IFuel interface which the petrol, diesel, electric and hybrid cars would
      all use. They would implement it in slightly different ways - the petrol and diesel cars would re-fuel,
      and the electric cars would re-charge. However, we weren't sure if hybrid cars needed to be re-fuelled
      <em>and</em> re-charged. If they did, you probably wouldn't do both at the same time. After a bit of research,
      it seems that they get charged from the alternator anyway; so in our model they'd be no different from
      petrol or diesel cars. We're not just learning about code!
      </p>
      <p>
      The homework was a bit lighter on Wednesday night. We had to research a bit more about
      polymorphism and composition. We'd be quizzed about it in the homework review the following morning.
      It was all easy enough.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Thursday</strong> was an all-day lab, and this time we were in trios. The task was a
      challenging one to say the least. We had to create a fantasy/adventure game. You could play as a
      knight, barbarian or dwarf; all of whom should have a hand-wielded weapon and armour to protect them.
      You could also play as a wizard or warlock, who can cast spells and also have some form of creature
      to protect them - such as a dragon. Finally, you could play as a cleric, who has armour but no weapon.
      The cleric can heal other players. You would progress through rooms, with each room containing either
      some treasure to collect or an enemy to fight. You should be able to defeat the enemy, and the enemy
      should be able to defeat you.
      </p>
      <p>
      We spent a good couple of hours on planning this out, as it was important that we didn't start going
      down the wrong path and then have to scrap the whole thing and start again. It made sense to create a
      top-level player class, with all player characters inheriting from that. We then created two classes
      on the next tier for the "spellcasters" and the "fighters", with the third class tier including all
      the specific character types.
      </p>
      <p>
      After getting the basic setup coded, we decided to branch off separately to work on different areas,
      then merge together again later. We had to do this really because we'd been taught to make the whole
      process test-driven. Every character should have a test for every property and method that they have.
      For example, the wizard had tests for "has name", "has health", "has spell", "has defence", "can cast
      spell", "can change spell", "can change defence", "can collect treasure", "can inflict damage",
      and "can take damage". We had to repeat all of those tests for every character!
      </p>
      <p>
      We didn't finish the lab, but we were relatively happy that we'd worked out the best way forward and
      with what we'd written so far. It turns out that noone completed the lab, but that wasn't all that
      surprising.

      I stayed on in the evening as I'd volunteered to help out with the
      <a href="https://coderdojo.com/" target="_blank">Coder Dojo</a> event, which takes place on the third
      Thursday of the month. It's a free event for children aged 7-17 (I think), and they can come along
      to learn some basic coding. It involves learning how to program a
      <a href="https://microbit.org/" target="_blank">MicroBit</a>, which is a USB circuit board with
      buttons and an LED display on it. You can press the buttons to get something to display on the LEDs,
      and you can also shake it or flip it upside down and it will detect that too. Oh, and it has a
      built-in temperature sensor so that you can code it to do things if the temperature is above or below
      a certain temperature. It's pretty cool!
      </p>
      <p>
      It turns out that there were far more volunteers than there normally are, so we actually outnumbered
      the students. Some of the students had more than one volunteer with them.

          It was really good fun, and
          I was taken aback by how smart the kids were! The student I was paired, along with one of my classmates,
          had been taught some
          Python at school, which is a language that we don't cover in the course. By the end of the session,
          we'd managed to code a dice, a game, and a temperature sensor. The game was rock, paper, scissors,
          which generated and displayed a random symbol when you shook the device. The temperature sensor
          displayed a symbol when the temperature reached 30 degrees, so it would only work if you held it in
          your hands for a while.
          </p>
      <p>
      After that, I was talked into going round to the local pub for a few drinks. This was in celebration
      of a new cohort starting (E26), and once again CodeClan had put up a tab. However, this was long sunk
      by the time we got there at about 8pm. In fact, the bar staff informed me that it was gone in under
      half an hour!
      </p>
      <p>
      I was pretty tired on <strong>Friday</strong> to be honest, but there wasn't much going on anyway. We
      got our homework after stand-up, which involved coding a "music shop". It should sell instruments and
      non-instruments, with each item for sale having different properties and price points. You can
     see where this is going - you'd have a top-level instrument class, which all instruments
      would inherit from, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
      I didn't start on the homework straight away, although I did hang around to shoot the breeze a
      bit before lunchtime. I decided I would get an early night and hit the homework when I was fresh on
      Saturday morning...

  <h4 class="blog-post">Week 13 <em>- posted 28/10/18</em><span class="collapser">-</span></h4>
<div id="w13" class="blog-panel">
<div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p>
      Week 13 was to be a relatively tough week. The first two weeks of Java were fairly easy going, but we
      were about to dive into a powerful toolkit called <a href="https://spring.io/" target="_blank">Spring</a>.
      <strong>Monday</strong> started with an introduction to Spring and what it was about. It's actually
      very difficult to describe what it does, because it does so much. It's like a massive toolkit, and
      you pick small parts of it that you want to use. We would be combining it with another framework called
      <a href="http://hibernate.org/" target="_blank">Hibernate</a>, which is used to connect to a database.
      For the database, we'd be using PostgreSQL (ie. Postgres), which we'd used earlier in the course when we were working with Ruby.
      </p>
      <p>
      What does all of this mean? Well, put simply, it allows us to easily connect our Java code to a
      database; and output data to a webpage. It would also allow us to post data to the database, which
      we'd do by conforming to a Restful routes pattern. Again, we'd covered this in the course previously.
      The upshot of all of this is that we'd quickly move from pure Java code to full-stack - in other words,
      a complete web app which can connect to a database.
      </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-7">
      <p>
      Following the intro to Spring, we moved on to "annotating" our Java code. We annotate it so that
      Spring can pick up the annotations and automate some tasks, which saves us typing out explicit
      instructions. Spring does a lot of the heavy and tedious work for us! For example, whenever we wanted
      to create a database table, we'd annotate with "@table" followed by the name of the database table we
      wished to create. Spring would then read the next few lines and create that table with all of the
      properties it found; each property forming a column in the table. It got a lot more complex than
      that, but it did save us typing out the specific database code we'd have to use otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
      There was a lot to take in, and to be honest I was struggling with it a bit. The part I struggled with the
      most was being told to "accept that it does it, don't worry about how it does it". Like others in the
      class, I didn't find this easy. I like to know why and how something is happening. For example, I've
      never really enjoyed magic tricks. If the magician doesn't explain how the trick is done - and they
      rarely do - it just annoys me. It was a similar sort of thing here!

      The homework was a research task. We were asked to research the concept of relational databases, and
      the types of relations. We'd covered this briefly earlier in the course. There are <em>one to one</em> (rarely
      used), <em>one to many</em> and <em>many to many</em> relationships. As examples, a one to one relationship might be a
      husband and wife. The husband has one wife, and the wife has one husband - all being legal of course!
      One to many might be branches on a tree. The tree has many branches, but each branch belongs to just
      one tree. And for many to many, that might be students and classes. Each student has many classes to
      attend, and each class has many students enrolled.

      We built upon this on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, as we learned how to create database links using
      Spring. I still wasn't fully on board with it. I got the gist of what we were doing, and was able to
      follow along, but at this point it felt like I would only be able to reproduce what we were doing by
      looking at a working example and copying the code line by line. It wasn't an enjoyable experience. I
      had a chance meeting with one of the instructors in the kitchen, and he assured me that I would get
      used to this feeling. When starting a new job, or even a new project, you might be presented with an
      existing code base which might be built using various frameworks and toolkits. You need to research
      and learn them, to understand what is going on before working on them.
      </p>
      <p>
      I persisted with it, and I should say that I found the power of Spring very impressive. It allowed
      you to manipulate tables in a database with very little code. You just point it to the tables in the
      database, and it pretty much does the rest for you. You just need to tell it how the tables relate to
      each other, which is why you need a good understanding of database relations (ie. one to many, many
      to many).
      </p>

      The homework for the night involved creating a User/Folder/Files model. Each user would have multiple
      folders, with each folder containing multiple files. So, the user to folders and folder to files
      relationships are both classed as "one to many".

      I still wasn't entirely comfortable going into <strong>Wednesday</strong>, and I mentioned it during
      the morning stand-up. The stand-up is meant as an opportunity to open up about any issues or
      "blockers" you're having, as well as what is going well. I'm not convinced everyone is always
      completely honest though, but to be fair, not everyone is comfortable speaking out in groups. I don't
      mind though, so if I have issues I let it be known!
      </p>
      <p>
      We continued with our Spring lessons (there have been many jokes about the first/second/third day of
      Spring etc), and we learned about JPA (Java Persistence API). This is a specification really, which
      states how Spring and Hibernate should connect the Java code with the PostgreSQL database. We don't
      really go into too much depth on this - we just implement it and customise it a little. These things
      are very difficult to describe without going into a lot of detail, and I appreciate my blog posts are
      long enough as it is!
      </p>

      Our final homework for the week was to create a whisky and distillery tracker. One of my classmates
      is a bit of an expert, so this was right up his street. In fact, his very first web app on the course
      was a whisky itinerary tool named "Ctrl Malt Delete" - genius!
      </p>
      <p>
      Anyway, the homework task was to create a whisky and distillery web app. It would <em>technically</em>
      be full stack, but...  not really. A database and API were already set up for us in the homework start
      code. If you entered your computer's address into the web browser ("localhost") followed by "/whiskies",
      it would display a list of all whiskies. If you entered "/distilleries", it would display all
      distilleries. Our task was to create custom routes. For example, you could enter "/whiskies/age/12"
      to display all 12 year old whiskies. I didn't find it too difficult, which was a good sign that I was
      overcoming the difficulties I experienced at the start of the week.

      <strong>Thursday</strong> was a nice day. We had an all-day paired lab, and as both myself and my
      partner had got to grips with the week's content, we finished it really quickly. By lunchtime, in
      fact. To be honest, I wouldn't have finished it that quickly if it were just me, but I felt entirely
      comfortable with the process at this point.

      We were to reconvene at 3:30pm, so I took the opportunity to continue working on my JavaScript game -
      a version of "Play Your Cards Right" that I'd mentioned previously. I'm quite pleased with how it's
      turned out, which is very much as I envisioned. There are one or two compromises that I've made, in
      order to get it to work on the largest range of devices. It's very frustrating when you've perfected
      a layout on a laptop/desktop, only to find that it completely breaks on a mobile phone or tablet. And
      then, when you've modified it to support mobile devices, you have to consider what happens if the
      device is rotated between portrait and landscape.

      No homework night on Thursday - so I popped round to the local for a couple of drinks after we'd gone over the
      lab exercise. Thankfully, we were back at The Chanter (£3 per pint) this week as opposed to Bar 4042
      (£4.50 per pint) last week. These things matter a lot more when you have no income and you don't know
      where your next wage is coming from!

      I arrived on <strong>Friday</strong> in good spirits (no pun intended), amidst the spooky cobwebs, to collect our
      homework for the weekend. I was surprised to discover that it wasn't a review of the week as it
      usually is. Instead, it was JavaScript based homework. More specifically, we were to refactor some
      code we'd used earlier in the course to take advantage of some newer JavaScript features. These
      features were only made available 3 years ago in the JavaScript ES6 release. Next week we'd be
      learning how to use a JavaScript library called <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">REACT</a>,
      so presumably the weekend's homework was in aid of that.
      </p>
      <p>
      There was a talk on in the afternoon from a local company called
      <a href="http://bemo.co/" target="_blank">Bemo</a>. In fact, they're based next door in Codebase.
      They specialise in developing mobile apps, and they have some well known clients such as STV and the
      BBC.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a really good talk, and very honest too. They have hired CodeClan students in the past,
      but aren't likely to be hiring any more in the near future. The reasons for this were explained, and
      part of it is that they need people to hit the ground running. It is a little disappointing as they
      sound like a great company to work for, but, at the same time I appreciate their honesty.

      Week 14 started exactly as it ended - contemplating the end of the course and making the leap into
      employment! A few of my classmates have been applying for jobs already, and some have had interviews
      too. As I mentioned previously, I decided against jumping into job applications too early. I want to
      put one final effort into the last part of the course - and the final project.
      </p>
      <p>
      We'd be learning the REACT framework this week, which is a JavaScript-based front-end framework which
      allows you to quickly build up webpages out of components. In "traditional" web design, the structure
      of the page is created (HTML), then one or more separate stylesheets are created to change the look
      of the page (CSS). Finally, further separate JavaScript files can be created to add
      functionality/interactivity to the page. REACT brings the HTML and JavaScript together into each
      component, and also automates a lot of tasks that you'd otherwise have to type out yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
      So that's how <strong>Monday</strong> kicked off. We discussed the principles behind REACT, one of
      which is that it's one-way data flow. You have a top-level component, and nested components within
      that. Any data which is to be displayed on the page flows down from the component above it. It's not
      <em>technically</em> true, as far as I'm concerned, because we all know that when you click on
      something on a page it can make something happen elsewhere on the page. That can't happen without
      two-way data flow. Perhaps I'm being pedantic, but I think that you need to question things to
      completely understand them and how they relate to the bigger picture.
      </p>
      <p>
      We also learned about how REACT creates a "virtual DOM". The DOM is the Document Object Model, and it
      basically lists every element on the webpage. Making changes to the DOM - such as adding or removing
      an image from the page - can be quite intensive in terms of computing power used. So, REACT creates a
      virtual copy of the DOM, and only interacts with the "real" DOM when necessary. We were told that
      this is more efficient; but again I questioned that. I didn't have to look very far to confirm my
      suspicions, that REACT is in fact
      <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-i-converted-my-react-app-to-vanillajs-and-whether-or-not-it-was-a-terrible-idea-4b14b1b2faff" target="_blank">slower than "vanilla" JavaScript</a>
      - but only really on complex webpages. In the vast majority of cases it's about the same speed.
      However, performance isn't really why you'd use it. You'd use it to create webpages faster and more
      efficiently. That's pretty much the case with any framework or library.
      </p>
      <p>
      We had a relatively small homework assignment, which was to build a basic REACT-based webpage which
      displayed film releases. There wasn't an awful lot to it, but it still took me twice as long as it would
      have done if I weren't using REACT. I'm guessing that these tables will turn once I get over the
      learning curve.
      </p>
      <p>
      The next couple of days were largely about practicing with REACT, and building up the complexity of the
      webpages we were creating. We returned to API connections again on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, which in
      this context are connections you make to a server to receive "raw" data back. You'd then output it on
      your webpage.

      <div class="col-sm-7">
      <p>
      We had a mini-lab to refresh our memories on this. I was surprised at how much I'd forgotten. Well, I
      say "forgotten" but upon referring to my notes it soon came rushing back to me. That's an important
      point actually - you don't need to remember exactly how to do <em>everything</em>, and you'll always have to
      refer back to notes. The main thing is to remember that you can do something and why you'd do it.
      We're not robots, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
      Our homework involved building a small webpage which connects to the iTunes API, to display the top
      20 songs in the iTunes charts. Of course, we had to build it using REACT. The added extension was to
      show the top 20 books, TV shows or films; but unfortunately the API didn't support the connection. It
      took me a while to figure this out, which was a little frustrating. On the one hand I feel that
      CodeClan could maybe review the homework content to make sure it's actually feasible, but then on the
      other, I appreciate that these are the types of problem we might encounter in the "real world".

      <p>
      It was another all-day paired lab on <strong>Wednesday</strong>, which followed on from the idea
      behind the homework. The task involved creating a web app which connected to an
      API and displayed some information. We've had this task a number of times now, but it was really all
      about practicing with REACT. There were quite a few staff members and students roaming around in
      Halloween costumes as there was a party in CodeClan that night, so we were a little distracted from
      the task at hand! I didn't have time to sort out a costume, but planned to go to the party for a bit
      anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
      Back to the lab task - we chose to use the <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA API</a>,
      with the idea being that you could select a country or coordinate (by using latitude and longitude) to
      display a satellite image of that area. We got a bit excited about this, having previewed the images
      returned by the API. We managed to get some clear images of Edinburgh, and we thought that it allowed
      you to specify the zoom level too. It turned out that we were mistaken about that, and also that we'd
      just been very lucky getting the clear images. Most other images returned were just clouds! By that
      point, we were too far along to consider switching to a different API. It was still quite a good
      result though. Sometimes I think I'm a little too harsh on myself - I look at what I haven't achieved
      rather than what I have.
      </p>
      <p>
      It was essentially our last homework of the course that night, and it's fair to say it was one of the
      hardest assignments we'd had to date. It involved dissecting the code of a REACT app which used a
      "router". This was to be the last piece of the puzzle to connect the back-end/database with the
      front-end, and I was surprised that we'd only be spending a day on such an important topic. To be
      fair, we were the first cohort to go through this part of the course in the new format (Java
      following JavaScript, rather than Java first), so we can't expect it all to be planned out meticulously.
      </p>
      <p>
      I planned to do the homework on site in CodeClan as I was hanging about for the Halloween party later.
      However, after spending an hour on it I thought I'd better head off to give it more attention. Shame really,
      as there was free beer! Study comes first though. So, the "router" part of REACT is a little difficult
      to explain, but it involves channeling requests on the webpage to the database. If the website was
      about budgies, and you clicked on a link to show all budgies, the router would make the call to the
      database to pull out all budgies and display them on
      the page. If you clicked on one budgie, it would pull that specific budgie from the database. If you
      filled out a form to add a budgie to the page, and maybe upload an image, the router would handle
      adding the data to the database. As always, it's not as simple as that, but that's the basic premise.
      </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-7">
      <p>
      The silver lining of missing the party was that I arrived fresh and full of vigor on
      <strong>Thursday</strong>. We spent the morning going over the homework and discussing REACT router
      and how to implement it. It actually wasn't as complex as I thought, but then I might not have felt
      that way if I hadn't spent the extra time on the homework. I should add that this was the last coding
      lesson of the course! I say "coding lesson" as we were due another PDA lesson the following day.
      </p>
      <p>
      The final project assignment was handed out just before lunch. There wasn't quite the same level of
      excitement as the previous projects, for a number of reasons. I mentioned previously that some of us
      were actively looking for jobs, so perhaps their focus wasn't entirely on the final project. Understandable.
      We still had our PDA content to finish too - I'll get to that in a minute. We also had our speed
      networking event to prepare for, which was scheduled for the following Friday.
      </p>
      <p>
      And finally, I think there was a
      feeling that perhaps we hadn't really learned as much in this module as we did in the JavaScript
      module. This module was very framework-heavy, which is good because frameworks are essential tools to
      maximise productivity. However, they generally only allow you to work faster. There's nothing that you can
      do with a framework that you can't do with "vanilla" code.

      The suggested project assignments included:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>A <strong>"Jurassic Park" management app</strong>. The idea is to manage attractions, as well as
        which dinosaurs can go into which paddocks.</li>
      <li>A <strong>news feed app</strong>, which fetches and sorts live news feeds via an API.</li>
      <li>A <strong>restaurant booking system</strong>, to manage customers and tables, as well as tracking
        spending.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      We could use our own idea too, so long as we had it approved by an instructor. It was also up to us
      whether we decided to work alone or team up, but I was particularly keen on working with someone. I've
      found that it increases the quality of output. Some teams seemed to form spontaneously - I suspect
      that these were pre-planned alliances! Others were biding their time before committing to a team, or
      even which app to create.
      </p>
      <p>
      I provisionally agreed to work with two other classmates on a "pet" app. The idea was that you could
      log in as a pet owner, or a service provider such as a vets or grooming service. I thought it sounded
      interesting enough, and it had potential to expand into other areas.
      </p>
      <p>
      I committed to both the team and pet app idea on <strong>Friday</strong>, but we wouldn't have time to start
      planning until the afternoon. This was because we had a talk scheduled first, to go over the speed
      networking event the following Friday. There are to be representatives from 9 companies, all of which
      are actively recruiting and considering CodeClan students. We would get 6 minutes with each company,
      and a chance to "mingle" with the reps afterwards at lunchtime. More on that next week, I guess!
      </p>
      <p>
      Following that, we had another lesson about our PDA. I mentioned this previously, it's the
      <a href="https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/16759.html" target="_blank">SQA Professional Development Award</a>
      that's pretty much included with the course (although it is optional). We have to gather "evidence"
      from our coursework to submit, which tends to be screenshots or photos of diagrams etc. I'm slightly
      behind with this, so will need to make time for it. Somehow!
      </p>
      <p>
      There was another talk at lunchtime from Dwayne Pascal of
      <a href="https://www.skyscanner.net/" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a>. You may be familiar with the
      name. They have been one of Edinburgh's biggest tech success stories in recent years. They were
      founded by just 3 people in 2004, and have grown exponentially since. They were acquired a couple of years
      ago by a Chinese firm for the best part of £2bn. I did notice that CodeClan seemed to be pushing this
      talk a lot more than the others I've been to, the proverbial red carpet was rolled out! They're not actively
      recruiting CodeClan students until at least September next year either.
      </p>

      <div class="col-sm-7">
      <p>
      I finally got to sit down in the afternoon with my new teammates, to sort out a plan for our project.
      We got our brief signed off by an instructor fairly early, which is essentially as I mentioned earlier.
      A pet owner could look at services for their pet, and a business owner could confirm and accept
      bookings. Hopefully we'd get it to do a lot more than that, but we had to produce an MVP (Minimum
      Viable Product) for sign-off.
    </p>
    <p>
      We agreed to meet on Sunday as well, mainly because we had such a late
      start on the project. We had permission to use space in CodeBase next door, as CodeClan is usually closed
      on Sundays.
      <p>
      A busy week lay ahead!
