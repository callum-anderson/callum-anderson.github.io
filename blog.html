              <h4>Week 1 <em>- posted 05/08/18</em></h4>
            <p>Well here we are, one week down already! Technically, it's more than one week because we were given
              plenty of pre-course work to do; to make sure we were all ready for the starting line. That
              consisted of:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>How to use a Mac (loads of us are Apple newbies, including myself). This includes learning keyboard shortcuts, which are vital.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/" target="_blank">UNIX commands</a> (ie. how to type stuff into a terminal to work with files/folders, instead of using the mouse). It's faster.</li>
              <li>Using <a href="http://jahya.net/blog/git-vs-github/" target="_blank">Git/Github</a> - which is a version control system to track changes to files you, or your colleagues, are working on.</li>
              <li>Getting your typing speeds up - <a href="http://10fastfingers.com/typing-test" target="_blank">normal</a> and <a href="http://www.speedcoder.net/lessons/" target="_blank">coding</a> speeds. You need to use all those other symbols on the keyboard when coding, the ones you'd normally never touch.</li>
              <li>Completing courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a> - mainly the HTML, CSS and Ruby tracks.
            </ul>
            <p>So, 18 fresh, eager-eyed students walked into CodeClan on <strong>Monday</strong> 30/07/18...  and actually, it was an easy
              first day. We covered Git again, because that would be central throughout the entire course. We upload our
              homework to Github each night for review, and we'll also be using it to collaborate with each other. As it
              happens, this very webpage is hosted on Github! Pretty cool, huh? The entire Github community is built
              around supporting each other. If you upload some code publicly, people can input to it and help you out.
              Completely free of charge. That same community spirit is inherent at CodeClan too. I love that.</p>
              <p>As the week progressed, things picked up pace a bit, as you'd expect. We covered Ruby arrays and hashes, which
                are basically just "collections" of things, or a way to store a bunch of strings (words) or numbers in a single
                container object.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-xs-12">
                <q>If you don't ask, the answer is no.</q>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-xs-12">
                <p>The actual lessons are quite engaging and interactive - questions are encouraged; and I certainly take
                  good advantage of this. We also get a quick 5-10 minute break every hour which does help to "cool the brain".
                  It's really unlike any other classroom environment I've ever
                  been in - including college and university. The instructors are super chilled, and approachable. It almost feels
                  like they're volunteering to do this, rather than it being their paying job. There are 3 instructors in the room
                  as well, with 1 leading at any time while the other 2 chip in occasionally from the back of the room.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-7">
                <p>We also have "Labs" in the afternoon, where we're typically paired up at random with a fellow student, and
                  have to go off to solve some tasks. When I say "go off", we can either stay in the classroom or head out to the
                  communal areas and sit on the comfy couches. This is known in the industry
                  as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming/" target="_blank">Paired Programming</a>, and I can
                  see the benefits. It only really works if the driver (person typing) is open to input from the navigator.
                  I was paired with three different people over the course of the week and we nailed it each time (top cohort!).
                  It is a bit of a learning curve for us all though. A former CodeClan student came in to give us a talk on Friday,
                  and she told us that they use Paired Programming where she works now. She said that some of the most skilled and
                  knowledgeable developers aren't necessarily good at working in pairs. Not sure what that tells you, but I found it
                  interesting.</p>

                  <p>We are assigned homework at the end of the day, which consists of a MVP (Minimal Viable Product - a term used
                    in the industry) and Extensions (going that bit further). The Extensions are optional, but I managed to complete them
                    all in the first week. In the mornings, we have a "stand up" first thing, where we all stand in a circle, pass a
                    ball around (only the person with the ball can speak), and share what went well or didn't go well the previous day.
                    This is something that is done in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/agile/what-is-agile" target="_blank">Agile</a>
                    software development companies, and you're encouraged to share any issues you have. I haven't really brought any
                    problems to the table yet, but I've no doubt I will in future. I like it, it's a great way to start the day. This
                    is followed by a homework review, which is really about addressing any problems anyone had, rather than going
                    over all of it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Thursday</strong> is no homework night! As it is our first week, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that CodeClan
                      had put up a tab for us all at a local pub. The other two cohorts were invited too, which was great for networking and to
                      quiz them on what lay ahead. They are 5 and 10 weeks ahead of us respectively. Some of the instructors also made
                      an appearance which was great. I had a great time... <em>but</em>...  made the mistake of heading out on an empty stomach.
                      I suffered for that later. And the next day.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Friday</strong> was a bit of a break from coding. We had a lesson about active learning, which was very interesting and
                      definitely useful going forward. Then we had a talk from a previous student (Kate), as mentioned earlier, who has gone
                      on to work in a local tech startup. She was fantastic, very down to earth and has a great sense of humour. She also
                      allayed a lot of fears some of us had. She is the only "junior" developer in her firm, and I asked her if she was
                      intimidated by that. She said she wasn't really, because her manager simply doesn't expect the same level of output from her.
                      I guess that makes sense.</p>

                      <p>We are issued our weekend homework in the afternoon, and some of the guys do it before going home (or as much
                      as they can), and some of us decided to do it all at home. I did the latter this week, but mainly because my stomach was a
                      bit iffy from the previous night's activities! The homework wasn't too bad though. On to <strong>week 2</strong>!

          <h4>Week 2 <em>- posted 12/08/18</em></h4>
      <p>We started on <strong>Monday</strong> with a "stand up" as always, and generally everyone felt the homework was manageable.
        It wasn't quite how I anticipated it to be, after reading other CodeClanners' blogs. I got the impression that
        homework would be 2-3 hours per night, and maybe 5-10 hours over the weekend. I shouldn't speak too soon -
        that might be still to come! We were then given 1 to 1 sessions with an instructor (out on the comfy seats!)
        to go over the homework and talk through any problems we might have. That took up most of the morning, and to
        be honest, it was nice to have a gentle start to the week. I didn't sleep so well on Sunday night, and I was
        thankful for the free coffee supply at CodeClan.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-7">
      <p>We were introduced to the concept of object-oriented programming and classes, which essentially means that everything
        you use is an object of some sort, and it is created from a blueprint (class). To be honest, I knew most of
        this already, but it was a good review. I'm determined not to fall into the complacency trap. If you think you know
        the subject being taught and switch off, any small details you miss could cost you later. The homework task was about
        creating a library which has books, and the books have rental details etc. Real world examples definitely make it more engaging.
      </p>
      <p>We continued working with classes on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, creating an "ecosystem" of a bear, river and fish. Each was to be
        an object which was created from a class (blueprint), and they all have to interact with each other. In layman's
        terms, the bear takes fish from the river and eats them - essentially meaning the bear has one more fish in its stomach, and
        the river contains one less fish. These things always sound so simple, but it takes a fair bit of code just to get to that point.
      </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p>We had another lab in the afternoon with a similar real world scenario - this time it was a bus picking up
        passengers from a bus stop. The number of people at the bus stop changes at every pickup, as does the number of
        people on the bus. That one was kind of fun actually, and we were to continue with it in the homework. A comfortable
        week, up to this point...
      </p>
      <p><strong>Wednesday</strong> was a bit different, as we were given an all-day lab following the homework review. Again, we were
        paired up, and had from 11am until 3:30pm to complete our task. We had to manage our own breaks, and I must say
        I'm not great at taking breaks when I'm focused on something. We did both agree that we should take a proper time-out
        for lunch, to eat and get some fresh air to clear the head. On that point - that is something I've resolved to do
        throughout. I've taken to walking down to Princes Street gardens to get away from the noise and pollution, and to just
        empty the mind of all thoughts. It really works - I come back into class refreshed and ready to go again!
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <q>Do you want to build a Snowman?</q>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p><em>Anyway...</em> back to the lab - we were given the choice of two tasks. The first was to create a pub, which obviously
        has drinks, food, and customers. We had to include a check to make sure the customer is over 18 before serving drinks,
        and to refuse to serve them if they're drunk (their "drunkenness" level goes up each time they buy a drink, and down
        if they buy food).<br>
        The other task was to build a Snowman game, which is essentially about guessing a hidden word. We had to output a word to the screen
        in asterisks, and each time the player guessed a letter, it would be uncovered. If they guess wrongly, they'd lose a life. I think
        it's called Snowman because the snowman melts a bit at each wrong guess...  I've always known it as Hangman, but maybe that's no
        longer politically correct?
        So again, the premise sounds very simple, but it was <strong>much</strong> more difficult than the pub task. We wanted a challenge, so
        opted for the Snowman task.<br>
        By 3:30, we had the crux of the game down, but we were still about 15 minutes away from putting it together into a functioning programme. <em>Argh!!</em>
        When we returned to class, we were surprised to find that we had to present our workings to the class. It was so frustrating not having
        the final result there to demo, but that's the way the cookie crumbles.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-7">
      <p>We decided to stay back at the end because we were both so determined to reach the finished product. We managed to get
        that done within half an hour. Again - <em>so</em> infuriating that we didn't have it ready in time for the presentation! Still, it
        was satisfying to finish it off before we left for the day. Our homework task was to review the solution for the <em>other</em> task
        (both solutions were made available to us by the instructors) -
        so for us that would be the pub task. I decided to go one step further and actually complete the task. I started it on the bus home,
        and finished it later on that night. It helped having seen the presentations from the other guys who had chosen that task.
      </p>
      <p>On <strong>Thursday</strong>, we went over enumeration methods, which is a way of iterating through a collection. For example, the .each
        enumeration method takes a collection of objects, and carries out a specified task on that object. One analogy might be
        "for each customer that enters the restaurant, give them a menu". No homework that night, and I decided to get an early
        night to catch up on my sleep. No shenanigans this week!

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p>We were handed our homework after stand up on <strong>Friday</strong>, and started on that at about 10:30. Most of us headed out to the lounge area,
        it just makes for a nice change of scenery from the classroom. The task this weekend was to create a sort of karaoke club management
        system. So, the club would have a bar, private rooms, guests/punters, songs/playlists and drink/food. So, similar to the pub task on
        Wednesday in many ways, but ramped up a bit. I got the core part of it (Minimum Viable Product) done before heading home. It's strongly recommended that you make a good start on the homework on Friday before leaving, as the
        instructors can't really help you if you're at home. Makes sense!
      </p>
      <p>A developer from a company called <a href="https://www.airts.co.uk" target="_blank">AIRTS</a> came in to give us a talk at lunchtime,
        which is apparently a regular thing on Fridays. His company have employed about 5 CodeClan graduates to date, and he was really
        encouraging, and gave good insights into the industry. Very down to earth too.
      </p>
      <p>Over the weekend, I worked on advanced elements of the Karaoke Club task. I thought about bringing it alive, and making it into a
        text-based menu system, but decided against it! I thought I'd use the remaining time over the weekend to look at other learning support
        sites that have been recommended to us. Namely <a href="https://exercism.io" target="_blank">Exercism</a> and
        <a href="https://www.codewars.com" target="_blank">Code Wars</a>. Both are community based sites that provide coding challenges, which can
        be completed in various ways. It's great to see the alternative solutions, they could come in handy in future! So that's it, on to
        <strong>week 3</strong> of the long and winding code!

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
  <p>Into week 3 and admittedly the novelty has worn off a little, but I'm still enjoying it a
    great deal. When I got in on <strong>Monday</strong> morning, we had our usual catch up before the
    instructors arrived. Most of us agreed that it was so much easier getting out of bed in the
    mornings; we all chose to be there and have the same desire to learn.
</p>
<p>
We started the week with an introduction to database queries, in the form of PostgreSQL. For
those unfamiliar with the concept of databases, it's essentially like a collection of data
tables that connect with each other.
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp" target="_blank">SQL (Structured Query
  Language)</a> is the set of instructions
you give to the database to get data back. Up to this point, everything we've coded has only lived
in memory. In other words, you can run the program and make changes, but it's all reset/lost once
you close it. Now, we're able to save information into the database to call on again later. This
is known as data "persistence".
OK, the database is stored on our laptops and only we can get to it; but it's still an important
milestone!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-7">
    <p>
<strong>Tuesday</strong> was a continuation of learning about databases. There is a lot to learn
and we've only really scratched the surface at this point. I have some knowledge of SQL queries
which does help a bit, but it's still been a bit of a struggle getting the syntax right. In the
world of literature or printed media, leaving a comma or semi-colon out of a sentence might be
frowned upon by the grammar police. In programming - the entire thing grinds to a halt.<br>
One of
the key skills taught by CodeClan is how to understand error messages, in order to pinpoint the
fault and correct it. It's extremely frustrating at this stage, because we're all repeatedly
making avoidable errors. I guess it's similar to learning a new language or learning to play an
instrument - sometimes you take a step back for every two forward.
</p>
<p>
Getting back to databases, we learned about "one to one" (rarely used), "one to many" and "many
to many" database relationships. In real terms, "one to many" could be like someone's shoe
collection - one person and many pairs of shoes. "Many to many" might be musicians and songs. A
musician has many songs, and a popular song might be played by many musicians.<br>
Up to this point, we'd been using a pizza shop model as a working example. We mimicked a customer
ordering pizzas. So again, a customer could place many orders, which would be a "one to many"
relationship.

The task for the lab on <strong>Wednesday</strong> was to create a music database. Right up my
street! I'm hoping to learn how to build an app to help manage my music collection - which is all in MP3
format - after this course. I don't tend to stream music from services such as Spotify, just
because I like to listen to exactly what I want and where I want; with or without an Internet
connection. I don't like the idea of Spotify (other streaming services are available) suddenly
removing music from a playlist I've taken the time to create. So that's a bit of a personal goal
for "later".

Anyway, the lab task was to create a music database containing artists and albums. We had to
write methods (otherwise known as functions - which is just a piece of code that "does
something") to add, update, display or delete artists or albums. The tricky part here was that
if you delete an artist, all albums by that album would have to be deleted automatically too.
The same goes for albums - if you delete all albums by an artist, that artist had to go. This is
why the tables have to talk to each other, because otherwise they'd become horribly out of sync!
When I got home, I decided to import a portion of my music collection into the database to test
it out. That took longer than I thought it would. I suppose I wanted to validate it, by giving
it a real world use.<br>
I might add that it took me twice as long to get home because there was a concert on in Princes
St gardens, as part of the Edinburgh Fringe festival. Rag 'n' Bone Man, I'm told. I usually
cut through the gardens to get to CodeClan, but they were closed off. The buses also struggled
to get through because Princes Street was mobbed. It made for a <em>very</em> long day.

On <strong>Thursday</strong>, we moved on to "many to many" databases. The first example we
worked through was a sort of "Trip Advisor"-style database. A location would have many visitors,
and a visitor would have many locations that they've visited. Behind the scenes, you need 3
tables - one for locations, one for visitors, and one in the middle (visits) to link them. The
tricky part was to get to the location table from the visitor table or vice versa, by using
something known as "joins" on the tables. It was a tricky concept at first, but it made sense
once we'd been through it in the afternoon lab.

I must say I was very tired by the time I got
home. It was "no homework" night, but for me it was straight to bed and don't pass go.

I arrived fully recharged and full of vigor on <strong>Friday</strong>. No need for coffee, so
I had some mint tea while the homework was handed out. There is a whiteboard at the back of the
classroom where we can write down anything we'd like to go over again on Friday, but so far we
haven't needed to do that.
</p>
<p>
There was a talk at noon from
<a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">National Records of Scotland</a>, which
was very interesting. They handle birth, death and marriage certificates; as well as the
national census which takes place every decade. They hold records dating back to the 12th
century, so you can imagine digitization is high on the agenda for them these days.<br>
There were a couple of questions asked by students at the end, which sparked a
discussion about the pros and cons of working in the public sector; as opposed to the private
sector. Their director of IT was there, and he told us that he took a considerable pay cut when
he left Tesco to join them, and that he has no regrets because he enjoys his job more now.
That's very much how I feel - I want to do something I'm passionate about.

Homework for the weekend was similar to what we've been doing for most of the week. This time we
had to build a cinema, with films and customers. We'd use cinema tickets to connect the two, and
the homework extensions involved adding screening times. That was the most challenging part
because - for the first time - we were using more than 3 tables in the database. And that's a
wrap for <strong>week 3</strong>!
