Callum Anderson - CodeClan Blog

This is a site about myself, and my journey through CodeClan (30/07/18 - 16/11/18). The main content is the blog, but there are also links to some of the projects I've worked on, and to some helpful resources.

As for the site itself - it's statically hosted on GitHub Pages, and is built on vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. I had initially used BootStrap, but replaced it gradually with my own CSS before eventually removing it altogether.
